aoo5hc-post	Me and my sister live with my Dad and despite being from a lower income family, my dad always buys my sister anything she wants. He makes sure she can have anything she ever asks for, and does it as quick as possible. But with me, it's a completely different story. I literally got nothing for my 18th birthday,  but my sister gets concert tickets once a month. My sister is doted on, but with me, I'm constantly ridiculed and criticized and literally PHYSICALLY ABUSED. My dad kicked me in the fucking chin today for having a different opinion than him. The worst part is my sister literally doesn't apply herself whatsoever and exhibits little to no empathy, especially for all the pets my dad lets her have. On the other hand, I work hard, pay for my own car, I'm graduating with a 4.0 GPA, and I got into one of the best schools in the country, and all my dad can do is belittle me.  It honestly makes me feel worthless	Neutral

b17urb-post	I almost did it. I almost ended myself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm in a better state of mind now, I'm safe. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But I felt unsafe. I felt lost. I did not want another breath.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A jumble of relevant info; [linebreak]  [linebreak] I am uninsured, stuck in a job I hate for the good money I make, stuck in a manipulative situation at home. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My boyfriend and I (24F) have plans to move away from everything, but even that adds to the stress that sits like an elephant on my chest. [linebreak] I'm depressed, clinically, and my anxiety runs rampant sometimes.  [linebreak] On top of that, I'm diagnosed with BPD (borderline personality disorder) and truly try to go above and beyond to not be the monster people with BPD are made out to be. [linebreak] I suffer the mood swings; the infinity on high to wanting to die in 2.5, the severe emotional reactions, the impulses. But i try to keep everything a secret, keep it inside my head. I don't want anyone to be a casualty of my emotions. [linebreak]  [linebreak] My guy is very supportive; he tries to be. He's fairly critical of some things and strongly opinionated. These are things I love about him. Sometimes, when I try to express my emotions, he's logical about things; i feel like I'm better off staying silent because i end up feeling worse, through no fault of his. I feel like I'm burdening him with my emotional distress, and that maybe I articulate poorly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So i do. I say everything is fine. I pushed my friends away because of work taking all my time, and my fear of being an emotional burden  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I try to work through it on my own. To stay rational. I don't want to be a monster. People say that those with BPD are egocentric narcissistic monsters. I don't want to be like that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But by hiding it I feel so fake. Like nobody knows who I am. Maybe I don't know who I am.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wanted to be done. I think about suicide often, but I always find a reason not to. I try to have a will to live. I crave affection and appreciation but feel like a leech asking for it, so I try not to. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I didn't kill myself. But i almost do, a lot.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  In the end, it comes down to who would feed my cats? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have to. So I strive on and try for better days. I'll beat this. I have to.

b4jlh5-post	Don't get me wrong at all, I think Steam is great, it's my go-to for games. But I do raise an eyebrow when a competitor that shows actual promise comes out and the reaction from the gaming community is overwhelmingly negative. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You have all the mindless drones spreading hashtags like "NOSTEAMNOBUY" and rambling and ranting about "anticonsumer" practices while entirely ignoring the fact that Steam has a near monopoly on digital games distribution on PC, something which inherently restricts consumer choice and stifles competition - the very definition of anticonsumer. But still, it's apparently an inexcusable evil when a company chooses to release a game on a store that isn't The Holy Steam Of Our Lord And Saviour Gaben. This sounds suspiciously like a double standard. [linebreak]  [linebreak] On the Steam forums I have spoken with may people whose only argument was to extol the virtues of Steam as opposed to the supposed evils of the Epic Store for merely existing and how Bethesda is literally worse than Hitler for the heinous crime of using their own launcher. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's one of the most hideous and entitled aspects of the outrage culture that has society by the neck these days. It's sad that people would rather see creativity and freedom stifled than people actually trying to innovate and compete in an industry where it's needed more than ever. [linebreak]  [linebreak] EDIT: Illustration. One guy on the Steam forums claimed to me that Steam's "sole purpose" was "to increase competition and increase consumer benefit". Uhhhhh... No?	Neutral
b600k5-post	## Take 1: Autonomous vehicles will kill transit / will change transit so profoundly that we might as well stop building transit and wait for them to rescue us. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We build transit for many reasons, but the *chief* reason is to move as many people as possible using as few resources as possible: this, in turn, makes commuting cheaper, and frees up certain resources (like road space, parking spaces, fuel, etc.) to relieve pressure on commuters who make other choices. This also helps make our cities work better: more transit, less traffic, more commerce, fewer accidents, fewer person-hours spent sitting in traffic, easier for law enforcement and emergency vehicles, ancillary benefits (better for the environment, conserve manufacturing resources, get around the city without a car...), everybody's a winner. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And autonomous vehicles have absolutely nothing to do with that. Look at it like this: [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many subway trains does it take to move 1000 commuters? 1. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many light rail vehicles does it take to move 1000 commuters? 5. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many double-decker buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 13. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many standard buses does it take to move 1000 commuters? 20. [linebreak]  [linebreak] How many private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? In the United States, about 650. (As of 2018, most rush-hour private vehicles carried about 1.54 occupants.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] And how many autonomous private cars does it take to move 1000 commuters? About 650. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Which is to say, in any city large enough to support higher-order transit, *when it comes to the key reason we build transit*, transit will always beat autonomous vehicles. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to other situations -- rural areas, small towns, places where there simply isn't enough demand even to sustain a basic bus service -- autonomous vehicles will be a major boon. But in the big cities, the fundamentals for transit will remain strong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 2: Transit agencies in Asia can turn a profit, so European and North American agencies should be able to do so as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Insofar as transit agencies in Asia turn a profit, they normally do so on their property holdings: they own the land above their stations, which gets turned into skyscrapers, which means dollars in their pockets. But this also means that these transit agencies aren't turning a profit *as transit agencies*. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have a friend who plays the trombone. She makes $100,000 a year, which is a *lot* of money for a trombone player. Of course, she makes that money by working as a *lawyer*. Should we therefore go around to every trombone player and tell them off for not earning six figures? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 3: Free transit would solve a lot of problems. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is a great solution for smaller communities, especially in cases where the agency spends more money collecting fares than it receives in fares. (After all, fares don't just get deposited in the farebox: someone has to count them, someone has to print and issue tickets, someone has to draw up reports, someone has to do bank runs, the agency needs a secure room to hold the money and fare equipment, fareboxes themselves aren't free... if you spend $100,000 per year on collecting/counting/depositing/handling fares, but only make $50,000 in the farebox, you're a prime candidate for getting rid of them.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Free transit is also a fine solution if you want to address specific social needs or social problems. For example, a growing number of agencies offer free services on New Year's night, and many also offer free services to and from major public events where drinking is commonplace. You might also offer free services between seniors' homes and shopping centres, or between campuses of a hospital or university. Makes a lot of sense. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But studies consistently show that free transit does more harm than good in larger communities as a general service. Specifically, free transit: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Causes driver morale to plummet. [linebreak] 2. Causes vandalism to skyrocket, which significantly increases maintenance costs and can also cause vehicle shortages. (If you're pulling 8 buses out of service due to vandalism every day, but you're only able to return 4 to service on an average day, you've got a bad problem.) [linebreak] 3. Turns vehicles into homeless shelters on wheels. [linebreak] 4. Attracts hooligans. (They can basically do whatever they want on the bus, and even if someone eventually forces them off... they can hop right on the next one.) [linebreak] 5. As a result of points 2, 3 and 4, free transit discourages "choice" ridership, and can actually increase the number of cars on the road. (If they don't feel safe and comfortable taking transit, people who can afford to drive instead will start choosing to do so.) [linebreak] 6. Significantly increases law enforcement callouts, partly because it significantly increases assaults on drivers. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it tends to do more harm than good. Even just charging a small fare (50 cents or the like) does a significant amount to deter these behaviours. Covering the farebox just unleashes it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 4: My city has terrible transit. It's so much better in [x]. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You think transit's better in New York, London, Paris, Chicago, San Francisco, Vancouver, Toronto, Berlin, Sydney, whatever? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it is: these cities do have more options and modes of transit than your average city. But go to that city's subreddit and I guarantee you'll see the same gripes and problems as your city: bus bunching, cancelled services, short-turns, confusing maps, disinterested drivers, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Don't confuse your three-day sojourn in, say, Portland (during which you never travelled in rush hour, only visited downtown destinations, and took the streetcar just because you *could*...) for the reality of what people who actually live in that city put up with every day. If you had to commute from the suburbs to downtown, making two connections and consistently missing your bus, you would feel differently: in fact, you'd feel similarly to how you probably feel about your hometown's transit agency. You have my condolences for the inconvenience, but you also aren't so special. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ---- [linebreak]  [linebreak] ## Take 5: Here's a cool technology: let's shoehorn it into our system without a rationale. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This goes for: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. Aerial tramways [linebreak] 2. Monorails [linebreak] 3. People-movers [linebreak] 4. Personal Rapid Transit [linebreak] 6. [Chinese straddling buses](https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/08/18/business/global/18bus1/18bus1-jumbo.jpg) [linebreak] 5. River ferries [linebreak] 6. etc. etc. etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Many of these technologies are *interesting*, but people tend to obsess over them to the exclusion of more sensible transportation modes. There are *specific situations* where these technologies may make sense (monorails are great for tourists, aerial tramways can move people across bodies of water or up mountainsides, river ferries are great in cities built up around the river, etc.), but simply building them for the sake of building them (someone decides "hey, aerial tramways are cool, we should build an aerial tramway!") means your city will dump billions of dollars into acquiring a white elephant. On the plus side, as the only user, you'll be able to take some sweet unobstructed photos! [linebreak]  [linebreak] When it comes to building higher-order transit (like monorails, people-movers, etc.), I've got a simple truism for you. You need one of two things: [linebreak]  [linebreak] 1. A *lot* of cyclical demand, to such an extent that buses can't carry the load. [linebreak] 2. A *lot* of conter-cyclical demand: all-day traffic in all directions, steady demand all day long. Usually this means linking a city centre with an amenity like a large university, a major intermodal transit hub, another city centre, a major shopping centre or district, a major tourist attraction, etc. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't meet either criteria... stick to boring, bunchy, uninspiring buses. Detroit hasn't really profited from investing millions of dollars in a people-mover. Sydney wound up tearing out their monorail after years of disappointing results. New Orleans built an aerial tramway which lasted less than a year in revenue service. Save your money.	Neutral

b9szy6-post	Which isn't to say that developers "should" include easy modes in games, but I think it's entirely appropriate for a review to report their subjective experience that a game's difficulty negatively impacted their ability to enjoy the game.

Reddit loves to criticize games for being too easy, but if you criticize a game for being too hard, Reddit pulls out all the stops to talk about authorial intent, and how not all games need to appeal to all people.

But when I did you turned your head away from me, never to return your gaze again.... One day I finally felt more alone than I ever had in my life. But what could I do? I loved you. You no longer loved me. I didn't need you anymore, so you no longer felt worth. That was so untrue. All I had ever wanted was to be be someone of lasting worth to you. In my quest to become a better spouse to you, I took away your power. I never meant to hurt you, but you couldn't find your place after I didn't need you to clean up my messes anymore. I can wish you had been different til the day I die, and it won't ever change the disappointment of my lifetime. You were supposed to be different. You were supposed to be my best friend. You were supposed to care. You were supposed to support me. Instead, after you reached out your hand to help lift me to safety, you immediately began searching for ways to discreetly push me right back off that ledge.

Keep your filthy hands out of my product; theres a scoop right there if you want to sample something!

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, the overweight girl may have personally insulted OP, but it was just her saying she was ugly... when OP then made an instagram poll, it was basically all her classmates at once calling the overweight girl ugly.

efqliiv	>I really wish we could get to the genesis of the hatred of bigger people. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As with all societal trends it's complicated but I think media plays the most significant role.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Movies, TV, advertising... everyone looks a certain way. Even non visual mediums like books and radio will *describe* people as having these certain looks.  And heck, you can see this even in how very body-positive overweight people dress/do their makeup.... they're still copying all the styles popularized by people of a more normal weight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't think that makes the body positive overweight people hypocrites though, which people will want to do... instead I think it just shows how unbelievably pervasive media and societal perceptions of beauty really are. Even a person claiming to be body positive will have makeup that mimics what you might see on a celebrity.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] There is an element of health involved. No doubt, being overweight is generally less healthy... obesity is not the way the human body naturally should end up... but I think that's so buried beneath the cultural elements that I find it generally hard to believe most people when they claim their fat people hate comes from beliefs about health and wellness.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >The average size of Americans has gotten larger overall, yet there seems to be a particular hatred for big people I cant wrap my head around. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So I actually have noticed less hatred for fat people in the past 5 years or so, perhaps owing to the increasing size of Americans. At this moment, some 2/3rds of Americans are overweight or obese.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, there's also an element one commenter pointed out that is clearly on display in this AITA post: self-hate/self-loathing... the overweight girl very likely is quite ashamed and sensitive about her size and is using the sassy, in-your-face body positivity as a cover... and I'm sure that many of the people shitting on fat people online are themselves overweight.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  >Mysogyny is wrapped up in it as well of course. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Absolutely. Especially I think in the sort of middle-range of being bigger... if you're slightly overweight as a guy, it's much more acceptable than being slightly overweight as a girl.  [linebreak]	Neutral

eft7cic	I think many people are just are not attracted to overweight people, and now days that's somehow a bad thing? I never have meet anyone who actually hated obese people. Sure its annoying when people who are literally dying from obesity are shouting at you that they are healthy at any size which of course is one the dumbest thing I've ever heard. Really, are we going to pretend anorexia and bulimics are healthy? No, so we should not pretend that people who weigh 300 pounds are healthy either, there is not a single piece of evidence that being fat is good for you, while there is literal mountains of evidence that being in good shape with low body fat is associated with health and longer life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I really don't see this hatred of the overweight you speak of, just because someone isn't attracted to you and doesn't want any type of relationship with you due to your inability to take care of yourself does not mean they hate all fat people. Personally I would never be with someone who is not in good shape, for a few simple reasons. 1) I take excellent care of my body and physical activity is a passion of mine, so if my s/o isn't into an active lifestyle we just wont match. 2) I want a life partner who isn't going to die in the first 50 years of their life from cancer or heart disease. 3) I'm just not physically attracted to overweight people, plain and simple, doesn't make me a bad person for having a personal preference. I work extremely hard for my low body fat % and muscles and it makes me happy, I'm much more confident, outgoing and energetic when im taking care of my body.	Neutral

[linebreak]  [linebreak] You are trying to use a very convoluted happenstance - driver's licenses - to try and make a normative point here, but it falls flat because the point has no merit. In other words, this makes no sense.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >Driving is not a right. [linebreak] And neither is cycling on the road. Yes, you don't have to get a cycling license, but that has nothing to do with it being or not being a right - and everything to do with the fact that automobiles are far more dangerous to other people than bicycles are. But at the end of the day, if some jurisdiction wanted to restrict the ability of people to cycle on the roads, they absolutely could, and there would be no legal standard of "it's an inviolable right" stopping them, the way it would was something like freedom of speech, the right to bear arms, freedom of religion, Etc - at least in the United States.

Most suicides want death but they don't want a messy or painful death -- there's a reason for that. Even though they want to die, they still care about dignity, they still care about being "proper" and "responsible" with the undertaking. A woman would most likely not be able to bear the fact that her mother would see not only her corpse but also her corpse being ravaged by some weirdo.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Those kinds of people exist and drive cars too, but there's 1000x more of them in cars, and cars can easily kill you. So I'm not super worried about the first group. If a cyclist is so mad they want to hurt me, I'll just drive away, or stay in my car or whatever. If a driver wants to hurt me they can kill people.	Neutral
eghdcgp	People think it's a dumb statement because it's a trueism. Yes, everyone should be careful. However, one of those is wholly more dangerous than the others. My cousin was hit by a bike when he was a kid. it caused some scars and some teeth got messed up requiring braces. Being hit by a car would have killed him. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cars are larger, heavier, and faster than bikes and those on foot. The menace to our streets is not bikers. Elite bikers top off to about 25 mph. I do bike cardio for an hour 4 days a week and I top off at 18 mph so I doubt your average bike commuter is Lance Armstrong-ing her way through busy intersections such that cops need to be there harassing them. Especially since they don't seem to have an issue with cars that block crosswalks or don't respect right of way. Which, again, is going to be more dangerous than a bike given the same maneuvers.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Cops are very much bullying bikers because they know they can. The cops in that vid (and other ones I've seen that focused on this issue) were literally blocking the bike lane then punishing bikers for not using the very passage they have blocked so it's not even an issue of "being careful".

eghkjta	I said something before but the cops aren't helping the situation.

He literally biked into the side of a car that was making a right turn because he jumped on the sidewalk and tried to use the crosswalk.

eghreh4	I don't agree with those people, but bikes can be dangerous.  Usually what I see happening in NYC is people on bikes flying through red lights without checking traffics.  There's a reason why you're supposed to stop, because somebody going through the intersection doesn't expect anyone to be crossing a red light and it could cause an accident.  Driver's not at fault, but it doesn't feel good to hit somebody and hurt them even when you couldn't have prevented the accident.	Neutral

eghyyxm	Drivers rarely get punished for running over bicyclists (or pedestrians) in this car-centric society, if they weren't drunk at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There was this really horrible case in Miami a few years back that was the exception: some douchebag was leaving the club at 8 am on Sunday morning and ran into someone riding his bike on Key Biscayne. The driver didn't stop, and actually *kept going* all the way home with parts of the destroyed bike on his front bumper. He not only killed someone but did a hit-and-run, probably so he could sober up before the cops got to him. They had to confiscate his passport before he was sentenced so he didn't flee the country. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It turns out the driver was this two-bit aspiring singer that had performed at my university once. Your standard acoustic guitar type.

egi336s	This reminds me of this ***one*** cyclist I saw ***once***. It was at a 3-way intersection and there were no bike paths. This cyclist crossed the road at the pedestrian lights to an island a bike's length away from the footpath. For some reason I cannot fathom, this cyclist decided not to cross this very short distance and instead rode his bike for about 50 metres into oncoming traffic (the only side of the three with a green light) before riding diagonally to the footpath. The same footpath that was about a metre from the island he was at. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've seen thousands of cyclists in my area, even teenagers, who ride safely. Just last week I watched two teenagers on bikes cross the road when the pedestrian light was green and causing absolutely no threat to themselves or others. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] If the police are going to punish any cyclist it should be the ones who are obviously riding dangerously and unfortunately, it's these ones who ***never see any repercussions for their obviously dangerous behaviour.*** Worse still, it is people like the one cyclist who ignores the rules that ruin it for everyone else and just encourage the hatred that drivers and pedestrians have for cyclists.

egi6vvn	Is this a South Park character?	Neutral
egi8n4z	The problem is that bicycles are considered vehicles the same way that cars are for some reason. If you hit a car at a stop light it's not a crime and the only repercussions will be points on the lisence of the at fault driver, do the same thing with a cyclist and the law views it the same way, even though the risk of serious injury and death is much higher. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The case you mentioned became a crime because the driver left the scene of and made it a hit and run. There are even rarer cases like what happened in Kalamazoo Michigan a few years ago where a driver went out of their way to hit a group of cyclists and was charged with multiple counts of murder.

egibnx5	**Cyclists need to be aware on the road** [linebreak]  [linebreak] I learned to ride a motorcycle. This is something that is not really mentioned but is wholly related. Obviously, cars are a huge risk to those who ride a motorcycle for the same reasons cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What you're taught as a motorbike rider, the most important lesson, is that you're responsible for you. You cannot rely on a driver to be looking out for you. Not because they don't want to but because, like cyclists, you're less visible. Cars have blind spots and you can't expect them to always see you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The second most valuable lesson is that motorcyclists tend to make better drivers because they're more aware on the road and responsible for their driving decisions. They're more concerned about reacting to other drivers decisions rather than driving on autopilot and going, "oopsie" when something unexpected happens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being aware of your surroundings as a cyclist or motorcyclist is still essential to safety. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Cyclists need to be aware on footpaths (sidewalks)** [linebreak]  [linebreak] A car is predictable. In most cases, a car will be on the road. Unless it's pulling out of a driveway it's very rare to see a car that isn't on the road and it's impossible to see a road and not know that a motor-vehicle will use that road. Driving has rules. You stick to the designated areas and should there be any reason to be where a pedestrian might walk you look and wait for any to pass.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The same isn't said for footpaths (or sidewalks I think it's called where you are), bike tracks and cyclists. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the case in many places here that both footpaths and bike tracks are shared by pedestrians and cyclists. It doesn't make sense to me either but basically, there are footpaths that just end in bike tracks and force pedestrians to use the bike track to get from point A to B. This usually isn't a big problem and pedestrians on a bike track are automatically more aware of the possibility of a cyclist. (If ever a reason to have ***more*** bike tracks exists, this is not a bad one at all) [linebreak]  [linebreak] The problem is the unpredictability of cyclists and a lack of presence.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A cyclist, here at least, is in no way predictable. A pedestrian will use a footpath, a car will use a road and a cyclist will use whatever is convenient at the time. With a lack of presence, it's impossible to know if you'll even see a cyclist on that day. Together you end up with both drivers and pedestrians not being able to anticipate if or when a cyclist is going to be there or how they're going to behave. This means a cyclist has to be more aware of their surroundings than the pedestrian as the pedestrian has no way of knowing how to react even when aware of the cyclist due to the unpredictability of the situation. In my experience with cyclists, there is no definitive answer to "how do I avoid a pedestrian". Some move to one side of the footpath, some ride on the road, some ring their bell so you can move out of their way and some creepily follow behind at a slow pace without ringing their bell until you notice and step out of their way like they expect you to be psychic or something. That last category is the jerks.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Unlike with cars, there isn't some set rule that applies to all cyclists and pedestrians and unlike bike tracks, you can't stay aware of things you're unlikely to encounter. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The solution to this is actually having more bike tracks and cyclists rather than less. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I overthought the ***fuck*** out of this and strayed way beyond the original point of the thread.	Neutral

I seriously think of everyone just gave a tiny bit of a damn about anyone but themselves for more than a microsecond each day, a lot of these problems would get solved without anyone dying, getting injured, or even getting angry...

Even if you're skeptical about his policies, he's literally a senator my dude. http://occasionalplanet.org/2016/03/04/a-list-of-bernie-sanders-accomplishments/ [linebreak]  [linebreak] - He polls better among minorities than he does among the whites.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - His foreign affairs look great to me. You haven't said much that I can respond to, but he's against excessive military force and the war on terror. If he applies the same morality to international affairs that he applies to internal, I feel like he's definitely in good shape. The campaigning candidate is different from the elected candidate but hopefully we'll see.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - He has a better grasp on economics than the majority of politicians that I've observed. Gutting the working class to subsidize the rich is never going to work but until he started stirring up shit, it seemed like almost all Democratic politicians were right on board for that. Glad that's changing.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] - As far as being an easy opponent do destroy, he's the Democratic frontrunner with lots of grassroots support. Hillary wasn't able to completely wipe him out even after getting the nomination. It's not 2020 yet, but enthusiasm for him has remained pretty stable since 2016. Grassroots support was one of the keys to Obama's success and the Democratic party itself has adjusted its metrics for candidate eligibility to include that, so he's ticking a lot of the right boxes for that party overall.

Trump has made it clear his 2020 strategy is going to be him screaming about the Democrats being anti-Semitic and socialists. The first can't work on Bernie because he's a Jew, the second Bernie will just say "yeah so?"

[linebreak]  [linebreak] If I don't have headphones, he'll start talking, try to make eye contact, and grab my arm. Last time it was some guy who "really wanted a chat" in the middle of the pavement. Turned out he'd been high for the last 72 hours, and just wanted to go back to mine to fuck, and the fact I had a partner wasn't enough to deter him.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had tried the whole wasn't paying attention thing, but he'd started walking beside me talking by then, so it didn't really help.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] How many leaks around the Nunes memo?   How many around the Mueller investigation?    The answer is you don't know what evidence Mueller has.   So when you suggest that he doesn't have any proof, you're saying something you don't know for a fact to be true. [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I believe it is an established maxim in morals that he who makes an assertion without knowing whether it is true or false, is guilty of falsehood; and the accidental truth of the assertion, does not justify or excuse him."

ei2x0sd	If Trump was guilty of everything he was charged of, a traitor worthy of execution, an asset of Russia working against the state, an open and shut case, you'd think he'd be reprimanded in some way. That they'd want to take the atomic football away as quickly as possible. How irresponsible would the FBI, CIA, Mueller be for letting this drag out so long. [linebreak]  [linebreak] We're about 50 nothingburger's into this. The dossier turned out to be fake. Clinton and CNN both said Russia collusion was just a political play with no backing. Stormy Daniels had to pay Trump's lawyer fees. Buzzfeed's bullshit was fake. Has -anything- turned out to be real? Wrapping up this case is logically nothingburger #51.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Everyone around Trump's admistration that's been found guilty has been tangentially related at best. Manafort was found guilty for money laundering, and crimes related to helping Ukraine... in the Ukraine conflict that was in defense against Russia. Others have been perjury. Manafort's crimes are lesser than what was found in Clinton's group to boot. That's all. Cohen was supposed to be this huge bomb, and he had no proof either, and just further perjured himself.

ei37jy2	I would say Honest Abe Lincoln would have more problems with an open-ended investigation that was based on a false report (the Steele dossier).  A defense of the Republic requires us to be vigilant of any overreach of government power, and the power of a prosecutor with a blank check to investigate anything is among the most dangerous power there is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Then there's the fact that as you pointed out so many leaks during the Mueller investigation.  Does anyone seriously believe that if the investigation uncovered a "smoking gun" evidence that it won't be leaked and end up on the front page of the NYT the very next day?  The fact no such event happened strongly suggests that Mueller tried for nearly 2 years but couldn't find any crime to tie to Trump.	Neutral

ei3iikd	[linebreak] The most infuriating thing Bernie's ever said is probably [this video.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.mediaite.com/online/heres-that-time-bernie-sanders-bellowed-ive-said-black-50-times-at-black-audience-and-why/amp/) At a speaking engagement in 2016, a woman said that black people in America face specific forms of oppression that other races do not, and she asked to speak about what he would do to help black people specifically. He interrupted her and said  [linebreak]  [linebreak] >"You and I may have a disagreement on this," Sanders said, "because it's not just black, and it is Latino, there are areas in America, including poor rural areas, where it is white. Okay?"  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He seriously told a black woman he disagrees with her on racism! He told her they had a disagreement on her own life experiences! [linebreak]  [linebreak] The fact that [he thinks class is more important than race](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2016/nov/22/bernie-sanders-identity-politics-class-race-debate) just displays a poor understanding of both issues.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another classic example of Bernie's deliberate cluelessness when it comes to race is is [this series of tweets](https://mobile.twitter.com/BernieSanders/status/794941635931099136) in which, three days before the election in 2016, he said Trump supporters are not racist and everyone else has a responsibility to reach out the Trump supporters and build a better society for them.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Another great example was when he said ["There are a lot of white folks out there who are not necessarily racist who felt uncomfortable for the first time in their lives about whether or not they wanted to vote for an African-American."](https://www.thedailybeast.com/bernie-sanders-on-andrew-gillium-and-stacey-abrams-many-whites-uncomfortable-voting-for-black-candidates).  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My personal favorite, which is to say least favorite, is the time that an audience member at one of his appearances said she wants to become the second Latina Senator in US history, and he cut her off to say ["It's not good enough for somebody to say 'hey I'm a Latina vote for me' that is not good enough."](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/94221972)  [linebreak]  [linebreak] One that's less serious but still deeply concerning to me personally is this [piece of creative writing from him where he describes a woman being bound and gang-raped in graphic detail. ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2015/5/28/8682503/bernie-sanders-rape-fantasy) I really just don't trust men who fantasize about abusing women. In my own experience, that fantasy belies some pretty violent subconscious sexism. [linebreak]  [linebreak] [This video](https://mobile.twitter.com/mgranville1/status/1091772831401234432) where he calls Asian people "yellows" is also pretty great.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He got Trump elected because [1 in 10 of his voters](https://www.npr.org/2017/08/24/545812242/1-in-10-sanders-primary-voters-ended-up-supporting-trump-survey-finds) ended up voting for Trump.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] He also got Trump elected because [Russian propagandists helped him and his campaign ](https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/348051002). There's a reason that Russian trolls knew his voters would be willing to not vote for Hillary in the general. He built a coalition of racist white leftists just like Donald Trump did on the right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The best evidence that Bernie is racist might just be the fact that in the 2016 primary, [he received 23.1% of votes from black voters and Hillary Clinton won 75.9%](http://graphics.wsj.com/elections/2016/how-clinton-won/). Black people tend to dislike racism.	Neutral
ei3ik5a	And then, when it comes to misogyny, one of the things about Bernie that I find most infuriating/scary is his bad record on women's health. [His healthcare plan](https://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/1/19/sanders-plan-republican-wet-dream-womens-health) involves Medicare for all, but it does not involve repealing the Hyde Amendment. Under the Hyde Amendment, federal funds cannot be used to pay for abortion. If his proposed healthcare plan was put into place, it'd become even harder for women to access abortions than it already is,  because there would no longer be private insurance carriers.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Even if he improves his plan, he's shown repeatedly that he just doesn't value women's reproductive rights that much. In 2016, when Planned Parenthood endorsed Hillary Clinton, he said ["I have friends in Planned Parenthood, but you know what, Hillary Clinton has been working with them for a long time, and some of these groups are, in fact, part of the establishment."](https://www.thepeoplesview.net/main/2016/1/19/unfit-to-lead-bernie-sanders-pp-hrc) He tried to turn Hillary Clinton's past work with Planned Parenthood into a negative. I don't want to vote for anyone who could say that with a straight face.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In 2017, [he campaigned for an anti-abortion democrat](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2017/08/02/opinion/trump-democrats-abortion-litmus-test.amp.html) in Nebraska. When faced with criticism, he defended himself by saying ["You just can't exclude people who disagree with us on one issue."](https://www.npr.org/2017/04/20/524962482/sanders-defends-campaigning-for-anti-abortion-rights-democrat) This one is pretty much self-explanatory, but basically, he's willing to sacrifice reproductive rights to accomplish other goals. I think that's wrong because a person's right to bodily autonomy is absolutely mandatory. Being anti-choice should be a dealbreaker for the Democratic Party, every time, no matter what. Personally, I think anyone who doesn't understand that doesn't value my rights enough to convince me to vote for them.	Neutral

ei3k7h5	>  How many around the Mueller investigation? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Mueller's team has been leaking left and right.  There was even a moderately big news story (not on the leftist media of course) regarding the Stone arrest, because the indictment was illegally leaked to CNN before it was filed with the court.  That's how CNN knew to show up half an hour before the agents who did the raid.	Neutral
ei3kz7y	The majority of Dems thought Bush had a role in 9/11, as did Jones. He was always a useful idiot they supported until his politics began conflicting with theirs.	Neutral
ei3opi3	The most important argument I emphasize is that Sanders is a political candidate just like everyone else. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's crazy how so many Americans (particularly young voters) thought and still think he's some sort of pure newcomer that doesn't have the problems that other presidential candidates do. They say he's not corrupt, represents the working class, truly connects to people, and would bring sweeping changes such as large taxes on the one percent and free college.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In reality, Sanders is irresponsible, lacks the pragmatic ability to put ideas into practice, and has remained grossly over-simplistic on the economy, race, international affairs, and other issues. His personal history speaks volumes to his ineptitude as a candidate. In particular, his lack of significant work to show his commitment to politics and the country.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] His actions are self-centered (e.g., continuing to campaign when he had no chance of winning and continuing internal strife within the Democratic Party, etc.), immature (e.g., as though every thing that happened in the country was primarily some sort of rigged, systematic injustice carried out by elitist individuals who control everything. And, seriously, "Feel the Bern?" is your campaign slogan? Not to mention all the ridiculous memes portraying him this way. Because everyone knows memes are well-justified, valid arguments about knowledge.), and in many ways more dangerous than Trump's actions, in my opinion. And he's a socialist. I'm not voting for a socialist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The primary reason why he didn't face much opposition was because the Republican party and Republican citizens generally wanted to stir conflict between Sanders and Clinton (so they didn't want to give Clinton ammo), and that they would save much of their attack for the general election against Clinton herself.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Funny, nobody has shown me a single country that affords that particular right to citizens.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The "right to be free from offense" is imaginary and unenforceable in a civilized society.

ej7d41t	I'm old enough to remember when PC gamers used to consider Steam to be the worst thing to ever happen to PC gaming.	Neutral
ej7dfvm	And look at 'em now...	Neutral
ej7imy8	This is completely misplaced. [linebreak]  [linebreak] People aren't celebrating Steam's monopoly on the market. People are complaining that *publishers themselves* are forcing consumers' hands by setting up their own stores. Apart from the fact that a lot of people just don't like the idea of giving certain publishers a bigger cut than they already receive, you need to consider that, paradoxically, this type of competition is actually anti-consumer. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's anti-consumer because, when these titles compete on Steam, they compete more directly. Consumers have more alternatives: if I don't like one publisher's product, there's another publisher's product just a few clicks away. Often the two are competing right next to each other. That means games need to compete with each other on quality and on price. [linebreak]  [linebreak] When every AAA publisher owns their own storefront which exclusively sells their titles, they don't face such direct competition, and can conduct themselves accordingly: indeed, this is often their express intent in setting up their own storefronts. Fewer discounts, less scrutiny, more control over fan reactions, higher margins. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you don't like Steam's monopolization of the market, you need to outline the alternative program, not just cheer as publishers carve it up and leave consumers behind.	Neutral
ej7lkn7	I haven't really seen much outrage about publishers using their own launcher like bethesda or EA, it's just considered annoying. The outrage is in epic buying exclusives for their own launcher, which isn't actually competing since there's still only one choice for the consumer and the launcher epic uses is incredibly inferior to steam.	Neutral
ej83e55	Redditors are blindly loyal to a company that was hesitant to disavow a game literally called Rape Day? Colour me unsurprised.	Neutral
ej8d0im	Yeah, I don't remember there ever being controversy over, say, GoG. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Having Store A be the only place providing Game X and Store B the only place providing Game Y isn't competition that benefits consumers; if I want to play X then I don't have any more choice than with a monopoly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sure, some folk just seem to be riled up because they don't want to install more crap on their computers, and/or they're just used to having all their games on Steam. They might seem like petty reasons, but take a step back and what they're really annoyed at is having the option taken away and being forced into another platform.	Neutral
ej8mw9f	I've got no love for any of these profit-driven middlemen.	Neutral
ej927uc	There's a difference when comparing GOG and Steam. [linebreak]  [linebreak] GOG has its own market of older and DRM-Free games and it's also not forcing any company to exclusively sell their game there. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Meanwhile, Epic Store not only offers a shittier site compared to both GOG and Steam but there are also privacy concerns(Tencent a Chinese company which has invested in Reddit has invested/partially owns the site) but instead of offering a better service they use their Fortnite money to bribe developers into selling their games exclusively on Epic Store.

This exchange is pretty funny to me, as someone living in the communist utopia that is Vietnam (actually more of a state capitalist like China) where motorcycle is the most common mean of transportation and helmets are legally required.

ejhg1i5	> If someone wants to take the risk and go helmetless, knowing what they are getting themselves into, they should have the right to make that choice - even if I don't personally agree with the merits of it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] A factor that people like this forget is that wrecklessly endangering yourself doesn't just increase the risk of injury and death, it wastes medical resources as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] EMTs are often overworked and rushing to get from one emergency to another. By not wearing a seatbelt or helmet, a minor accident potentially goes from something you walk away from to something where EMTs have to lose time trying to stabilise and/or resuscitate you. This being time in which they might not be able to attend to people who got hurt for non-moronic reasons, read: not because they were too stubborn to take basic safety precautions.	Neutral

ejhlxul	I ride a bike.  I always wear a helmet though my state does not require it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The reality is that a helmet will protect from low-level injuries.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] People who advocate for choice about helmet laws may just be resigned to the idea that wrecking on a bike will probably kill you anyway. [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's sad, but I can see how my dad for instance has seen enough death to know that most of those wouldn't be prevented by helmets.  A sorta bleak resignation that most fatal accidents won't be helped by helmets. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I feel like "let's not add to those numbers by going helmetless and dying in less extreme cases". [linebreak]  [linebreak]	Neutral

ejhsjth	I dont necessarily believe that most FATAL bike accidents wouldnt be helped by helmets, but I will admit that the most traumatizing ones wouldnt. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being nearly or fully decapitated by sliding underneath a semi wouldnt be helped by a helmet. I will admit that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But dying because you dumped headfirst helmetless at 30mph onto a curb trying to avoid someone turning left in front of you? A helmet could and most times will save your life. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Scenario 2 happens ALL.THE.FUCKING.TIME. with bike riders.	Neutral

ek25ro8	I'm not really confident in my ability to discern satire from reality, but regardless, those subs are not good for your mind when you visit them too much. It's why I stopped going there, as well as /r/cringe, /r/iamverysmart, and so on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's a few that are good without being needlessly judgmental. Those are awesome.	Neutral
ek29abk	I don't know.  Every single post on nice guys is filled with comments from people insisting it's satire or faked. Sometimes that's the case, but mostly the comments  seem to come from folks who don't want to accept how many creepy men exist in the world.	Neutral
ek2wx23	I'm getting mixed messages from the admins	Neutral
ek34xy4	Don't know why you even ask this. The answer is simply that reddit is left-leaning.    [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And white people = bad.	Neutral

ek5qruw	Amen to that, brother.	Neutral
ek5r46p	I really hope the WPD void in my heart is eventually filled. I discovered the sub ~4 years ago after going through a rough breakup and it really helped open my eyes to appreciate what we have in life. I found myself being safer on the streets and more cautious around mopeds because I know how random accidents can occur. Its members provided great insight to what they experience in the field. The community seemed more like a group of first responders from all walks of life rather than a cesspool like liveleak or bestgore. By banning these subs, the website is essentially pushing its members directly towards these cesspools too. I've found the discord and saidit have been comforting but I'm waiting to find all the past members we've lost. It's disheartening.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Life is a fragile thing and many lose theirs without a tear shed so where does that leave us?	Neutral

ek5yw7s	It was a good sub. It made me aware of just how quickly your life can end, and it made me see so many unassuming things in a different light. I think that sub helped me avoid a lot of dangerous situations, and helped me recognize signs of when things were going to go south.	Neutral
ek5yziz	I know a number of people who claim their lives had need saved due to that sub, I also browsed it for "entertainment" but those guys were turned off of suicide because of that	Neutral
ek5zksq	Same here man, I believe they started a Discord though, which might be as 'mature'? If someone knows that Discord, hook me up with it	Neutral
ek607hk	I will be straight. I do not care for that sub. It's not something I'd ever get into myself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But banning this sub doesn't prevent anyone from actually dying. It does not harm anyone. Banning it is just a virtue signal, a way of pointing to the people who did like it and scolding them like bad dogs.	Neutral

ek69846	Yeah, I saw that shit and the garbage that followed it, it was really disturbing to see what was happening over there. Voat used to be pretty decent years ago, but now it's a cesspool of racism and bigotry.	Neutral
ek69lxs	/u/v0atg0at I can't reply to your comment.....it looks like voat links are banned here.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] That is one of a minority that wanted us. There was a bigger pitchfork brigade waiting cause most of them we banned from reddit cause of how toxic they were. They talked the admins into  de-modding us and literally got told to f#ck off.

ek6amh3	8ch is already pretty awful, but voat is like 8ch without any of the humor, but 10x the racism and hatred.	Neutral
ek6b9jf	Losing WPD was hard, but what's really shaken my confidence in Reddit is the fact that they were combing through DMs in an attempt to halt the spread of the NZ video. I knew the possibility existed that they *could* do that, but to actually see them doing it is without saying that they are doing it is highly disturbing. How many other times have they done it? How many private conversations have they spied on without the users knowledge? This is what I'd expect Facebook to do, and Reddit has finally reached that level of douchebaggery. I've heavily pulled back from a lot of subs, and how much I participate in Reddit these days.	Neutral
ek6c711	https://saidit.net/s/watchpeopledie	Neutral
ek6cm4z	Agreed, saidit seems like a decent alternative!	Neutral
ek6d2ut	The removal and censorship was pretty counter intuitive. People that actually enjoy watching people die will go to places like bestgore and other weirdo gore websites full of people that get a kick out of watching people get ripped apart. The subreddit was nice because you could see how this stuff happened easily because it would appear in your home feed sometimes and if you didn't wan't to see it you could just scroll. Hiding the fact that car crashes are a thing and people will die in accidents is stupid. r/watchpeopledie was well moderated and didn't have the toxicity of other websites. Now if I want to see that stuff I have to go out of my way and look it up on different websites which isn't easily done on mobile.	Neutral
ek6e0m4	That sub brought me to Reddit in the first place. Seems that's just the way things are, the internet is not nearly as cool as it was in 1994, and it seems like every time a new platform comes out, it will eventually get ruined.	Neutral
ek6eni1	not to mention those same admins have within the last few years proven that they can edit those messages at will. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So now they're combing through the private messages that they can alter at any time, for thoughts they dont like. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Meh bye bye reddit.	Neutral
ek6ev0l	Thank you so much for letting us know. I too miss the sub.	Neutral
ek6fh0a	The fact that people miss that sub makes me glad it's gone. If there's any justice in this world, fans of death and gore will have their final moments recorded and archived on the internet for randos to comment on.	Neutral

ek6ht6s	> fans of gore [linebreak]  [linebreak] You're mixing /r/gore with /r/WatchPeopleDie [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd wager majority of the videos didn't even show blood. A lot of them were things like car crashes. Some of them didn't even have humans visible (the brick video).	Neutral

ek6kfcd	Wow. I didn't realize it was gone until you posted this. How sad.	Neutral

ek6molo	Done! [linebreak]  [linebreak] Edit: also sent pm's to all else who asked	Neutral
ek6na4o	Other than saidit, the telegram group still exists. It was deleted 3 times over (pedophiles, rouge mods, the usual) but it's still around with over 200 users. Not as much content gets posted but a lot more personal discussions happen in their. Different then what goes on in saidit. I've talked to some pretty cool people and found it pretty interesting.	Neutral
ek6oau8	There is a discord. I can't access my account right now because im not home. I hate their dumb new location security feature. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If I can get into my account I will send you the link, if I can figure that out too.	Neutral

ek6offj	Does anyone know why it doesn't work on the app?	Neutral
ek6ouq2	You're right - I'm using "gore" as a catch all term for videos of people suffering and/or dying. For me, they're all in the same category. The only difference is the level of brutality. It's like the difference between soft core porn and hardcore porn. Fills the same desire.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm not even saying I've never watched. I was all over rotten.com when I was young and the Internet was new. It took a while for me to realize that those videos hurt you on a deep level that you cannot conceive of at the time. The effect is cumulative and it's permanent. I will never in my life forget the image of someone's head being sawed off with a knife, or a woman's toddler being hit by a train while her back was turned. Too many terrible memories that shouldn't have to be mine, or anyone else's.	Neutral

ek6qo9v	Yes! They're in saidit now.	Neutral
ek6s9sn	I have my degree in psychology, and while I'll admit that abnormal psychology wasn't my specialty, I did spend a lot of my studies in cognition and learning classes. People need **exposure** to truly grasp the tragedies we have in life. I'm not proposing we go around traumatizing people, but for many contemplating suicide, **seeing** the reality of death is a major deterrent.	Neutral
ek6setd	Not into gore personally, especially when it involves people eating live animals. I just wanna watch someone die, ya know?	Neutral
ek6skfc	I'm the OP and I'm not a fan of gore. You're confused. I just wanna watch people die, I don't wanna watch them suffer.	Neutral
ek6sn7s	lmao this has got to be a troll. Just read your comment aloud and think about what you're saying.	Neutral
ek6sr5w	It was also common on the sub to watch without volume (to avoid hearing screaming) or, better yet, because the sub is curated content, you can skip all the ones with suffering apparent in the title. People who think r/watchpeopledie folks are all into gore have clearly not visited the sub.	Neutral
ek6sus2	If I could pin comments I would pin this one!	Neutral
ek6t6dh	Not only in this entire thread filled with people who agree with me, I'm confused as to why you can't figure out the difference between death and suffering.	Neutral
ek6t9sa	live leak	Neutral
ek6x2w5	There is nothing wrong with Voat.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] It has a comfortable and familiar interface. If it was overrun with reddit users you wouldn't know the difference but everyone just leaves too quickly so nothing about it changes. People are going looking for instant gratification instead of trying to simply improve it so it just always stays the same.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Racist comments are rampant on Reddit. BPT just asked people to apologize for their whiteness ('it was just a joke bro we were just making a point bro') [linebreak]  [linebreak] The opinions on Voat are alarming but only because they are the majority. It could easily change without this "don't go to voat" attitude.  [linebreak]	Neutral
ek6x79f	Yes reddit is so much better just because the language is cleaner.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Voat will never improve with these attitudes and reddit *will* die.	Neutral
ek6xrna	I also read a number of comments (some of them gut wrenching) and the odd story about this actually 'helping' if that's a word I may use in this context. Not once did the sub promote violence and it was excellently moderated by /u/tejmar and I assume others.	Neutral
ek71kgs	Yeah Skyrim got blasted for adding those noOb-haNdHoldiNg tools like fast travel(which you never have to use) and map markers (which you could turn off) that make the game not take eons longer than it needs to if you're anybody but an EpiC GaMer with infinite time to spend on it.	Neutral

ek74zgf	Must be nice to live in a bubble	Neutral
ek75l9h	Oh please, unless you grow up in a war zone you would never be exposed to the amount of death that one single visit to that sub would provide. This is hardly a matter of me trying to live in a bubble, but you can rationalize it any way you'd like. Everyone wants to feel right and feel good about themselves.	Neutral

ek7dp93	Gone	Neutral
ek7dpd1	You messed a letter up but I see it now. Thought you'd forgotten me.	Neutral
ek7e5c8	We never forget those images, but we are better prepared for those scenarios in real life. We also gain a deeper understanding of death, and what a truly "peaceful" way to go is. Oh, and to avoid certain areas, like Brazil and anything concerning Saudi Arabian princes and such. (/s?) [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bottom line, it's someone's active choice to engage in that content. If they want to prepare themselves at the expense of a little sanity, let em. It only helps out society, compared to other places where they watch it for sport, as if it's some game/show where human lives mean nothing.	Neutral
ek7fi5b	I'd love a link as well. Cheers!	Neutral
ek7fznt	I just have r/morbidreality, which i got banned from, because somebody posted a religious killing and I blamed religion in the comment section..but that is against rule 2...	Neutral

ek7tm89	What do you mean? [linebreak]  [linebreak] My name is right there with the submission. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You should have known it was me because I DO sub some really awesome stuff here sometimes.  This is one of those times. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now... [linebreak]  [linebreak] You are over there on TuMOR, where I CANNOT post...saying:  [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Welcome brigadiers from /r/ShitPoliticsSays, we're pleased to host your shenanigans. Leave your weapons at the door." [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's hilariously hypocritical.  Your sub brigades mercilessly.  The upvotes on this post over there have increased since it was posted here ... so we aren't downvoting your shit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You've come over here because this is linked. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Technically you are brigading our subreddit right now.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Gold Saydie... you're gold!	Neutral
ek7vlrs	The problem with the map markers was there was very rarely an alternative way to locate things - you could keep the markers on, and remove all thought and exploration from the process, or turn them off and basically be poking around in the dark until you stumble into the important quest thingy. I don't think the criticism was really rooted in elitism, so much as it being a choice between two pretty un-fun ways to do quests.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Agree on the fast travel though. The map generally felt like it was put together with people exploring on foot in mind, and you had the carriages if you wanted to fast travel but keep it limited or immersive or whatever.	Neutral
ek7vru4	I alternate between laughter and grave concern [linebreak]  [linebreak] This shit used to be 100% comedy gold when it was a fringe group of weirdos...and it definitely still is, but now that it's a mainstream group of weirdos, it's a little more concerning [linebreak]  [linebreak] These guys will go away eventually, because they're objectively insane, my only worry is the damage they'll do in the meantime	Neutral
ek7vtur	/r/bestof has gone to shit too. Most thread are just blatant Republican hate and any dissent is downvoted immediately.	Neutral
ek7xlh5	"User explains with 3547 sources how Trump is a Russian bot made flesh" [linebreak]  [linebreak] I use to really like /r/bestof before 2016 and now if you just have a list of 100 links that are anti conservative it will get 2-3k votes and when you click the links none of them prove the point the OP is making. I don't even click the main post anymore I go to the bestof comments to see if someone has already broken down how the OP is wrong.	Neutral
ek7yloj	I got banned after repeatedly being pinged by them and answering the pings. [linebreak]  [linebreak] One of their mods came to this thread. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Every once in awhile I'll get online to her userpinging me at some other person saying, "Tell u/IBiteYou hello." [linebreak]  [linebreak] I have no idea why she does it.  I haven't recognized a single poster she has directed it at. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I guess I live rent-free in that head.	Neutral
ek7zuax	It amazes me how much they pride themselves on things they then criticize the right for.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The left shows pictures of their diverse field of staff and are proud of the strength of diversity.

I really respect what a lot of of those ridiculously tough games are trying to do.  I'm just too old to have enough time  to spend on getting good.	Neutral
ek8c3tb	Yeah of course, the main game of a video game, is to be fun. If it's difficulty impedes on this then it is deserving of critisicms. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But if the fun of the game is designed around its difficulty, and your ability to triumph despite the difficulty then if you're not having fun, it's probably just because you don't like that type of game. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So while bugsy3D can be critisiced for its difficulty, dark souls can't be.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I disagree that "git gud" is elitism (I mean it is a little elitist) , I think it more or less translates to "okay, so we could tell you the most efficient way to overcome this obstacle, but if we did you wouldn't have fun, because the fun is derived from learning how to overcome the obstacle" [linebreak]  [linebreak]	Neutral
ek8ctnd	difficulty isn't about what you are able to do, anything can seem impossible until it's done. but it's about the things you have to do to get to the finish. [linebreak]  [linebreak] it can be very tedious and boring. it can be a badly designed area where you constantly get blasted by enemies. it can be a bullshit boss design that insta kills you with certain strikes or heals itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] a game can be difficult without being tedious. The Division 2 is a good example of it. it challenges in a way that makes playing it satisfying. although it has some bullshit parts like the fucking roosevelt island, that last area in the stronghold was so ungodly annoying since there weren't good places to take cover and BT would just keep blasting me with their mini tanks and grenadiers. on the other hand i was able to do the capitol hill stronghold pretty easily since it was designed in a better way.

ek91ng7	And if you were talking about like, irritating stick, or maybe even quake arena, games where there is nothing but the main game loop, and the only point is mastery of said game loop (one is an arcade game, the other is a competitive arena shooter) -- That would have been an acceptable sentiment. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Soulsborne games are RPGs with in depth lore, and beautifully dark worlds to explore. The oppressive difficulty does serve a narrative point, but the big thing in the game, for a lot of the people who will be playing, won't be grinding their face on the walls until the walls break, but getting to experience that world and read that lore. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ~Slightly later edit because I remembered~     [linebreak] Heck, if anything, Souls encourages helping people out of their ditch. The message system (though I've never seen people use that shit properly, because people are complete dicks) and the summon signs that let you gank some bosses by pairing with 2 other guys (and people are actually helpful with that, if only because they get niceties if they help you out).

ek9650a	'Bad Faith' is even worse than that. They're not questioning whether you really believe what you're saying, they're questioning whether you'll easily change your mind if they bother to summon the energy to have a conversation with you. If they think you won't, they justify it as 'bad faith' because they can't easily convince you.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] That's really the bones of it, it's that vapid and self-serving. They think it's not worth it arguing with people who argue in 'bad faith' BECAUSE they actually believe what they're saying. The only want to argue against people they will easily convince. As someone who argues a fair amount on reddit for a reason that becomes increasingly less sensible every day, I'm jealous of their ability to dismiss people entirely because they don't like them and smugly believe it makes them morally superior.

ek9lqu0	Wolfenstein: The New Colossus was hard to the point of not being fun, full of cheap sudden deaths. I could beat the first game on the highest difficulty no sweat, but had to go down a few levels for the second. It was one of the biggest criticisms on release and I think it was patched to be easier.	Neutral
ek9oklb	That's especially disappointing. I find it really annoying when people treat basic quality of life decisions for games as "too easy." It's the difference between playing Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker with 3 hearts versus playing it with no sail. Once provides a challenge in limited resources and forces you to fundamentally rethink how you approach the game. The other is just a pain in the ass that drags it out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And let's not even get started with  L I N E A R I T Y. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are much better ways to analyze a game better than just calling quality of life features bad and watering down difficulty. Legend of Zelda: Majora's Mask 3D is a good example as the remake makes a number of changes on the surface trying to address hiccups the N64 version, but in doing so created new larger problems. There's a lot to unpack in that about how you can address one change but make something else considerably more annoying or eliminate the premise of the challenge set in the first place. The original Majora's Mask was and still is generally considered one of if not the hardest Zelda games in the series, and it'd be reductive to just say "the new one is easier, it's worse" even if the remake is easier overall.

eke8i1n	I got shit reflexes and coordination aswell, but you can get past it. Here, let me give you some advice: [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 1 - Just roll into Boss attacks mostly, their attacks are really telegraphed so even with garbage reaction times you should still see em coming. For most common hollows, don't lock on, run past them, pivot and backstab (their tracking is really shitty so you can dance circles around their attacks). You can also run straight to the boss rooms since you get iframes on going through fog walls. Learn your parry timings, especially on Black Knights and Gwyn, the greatsword ones are the easiest due to how telegraphed their attacks are. Don't wear heavy armor and always fast roll unless you got that sweet 76 poise and a high stability greatshield. Oh, and always kill the dogs first. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 2 - The PVE in this game is cancer, but you should be in this game for the PVP. The tracking is insane so backstabbing enemies is not a cakewalk. There are no iframes on fog walls so getting into boss rooms is even more of a task but the great thing is, the bosses in this game are super easy - they're mainly just variants of armored knights. My advice is, increase your adaptability so you can get atleast 99 / 100 agility for those extra roll / backstep iframes. Upgrade your weapons as soon as possible and keep your equip load under 50. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Dark Souls 3? It's pretty much just DS1 but with a some Bloodborne style faster paced action in it. You can still easily backstab enemies but parrying is somewhat less instant which makes it harder. The game also hands out rolls like free candy, meaning you can spam it and become a lot harder to hit. Like the first game, KILL THE DOGS FIRST. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'll add more to this later.	Neutral

Thanks to a friend's suggestion I rolled with a sorceress for a while, and that got me the furthest I ever got (up to Duke's Archives). But the game still relies on fast reactions and stuff, which means even the "easy" builds are still too tough for me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I lost interest almost two years ago, tbh. Just watched a let's play for the story content.

ekxoy8t	I think it's still fine. I think it's progress that people can also make fun of women like they do men. I mean men get called a fat ass all the time in media and in public. Look at Micheal Moore or Ted Cruz and how they really don't care cause they know people are well intentioned. Charles Barkley is not a women hater, and isn't planning on joining r/MGTOW or whatever women hate group. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Back in the olden days women were considered off limits for comedy and I think that's silly. The more equal praise, comedy, and hate there is for both sexes than the world will be more equal.	Neutral
ekxppm7	hey i like Charles Barkley, i think he's funny, but i also don't think being a woman-hater should be the bar we set for people we look up to. and women get made fun of all the time, it's not some progressive statement lol	Neutral

ekxthgv	I feel you, I don't think this is unreasonable. Jokes about fat women are always weirdly misogynistic because they usually rely on this idea that like, an unattractive woman is the worst possible thing in the world.	Neutral
eky2x40	what? no... just no...	Neutral
eky4ri3	I think it's a little off the mark to suggest that making fun of fat women is progress. Women certainly get made fun of more for being overweight than men do, and that seems like the opposite of progress to me.	Neutral
ekyvnsb	Uh, women were far from off limits for ~~comedy~~ being the butt of white dudes jokes. Even in cartoons women were pretty much bad driver jokes. If you notice that's what they had in a lot of Disney cartoons. They'd have a woman get in a car only to have it swerving around everywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's not "progress" to make fat jokes. Even if it somehow was, where exactly are you getting the supposed green light that it's fine from?	Neutral

elwncqq	**Bacha bazi** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Bacha bāzī (Dari: بچه بازی‎, lit. "boy play"; from بچه bacheh, "boy", and بازی play, "game") is a slang term in Afghanistan for a wide variety of activities involving sexual relations between older men and younger adolescent men, or boys. The practitioner is commonly called bacha baz (meaning "boy play" in Dari) or simply bach. It may include to some extent sexual slavery and child prostitution. [linebreak]  [linebreak] *** [linebreak]  [linebreak] **Pederasty** [linebreak]  [linebreak] Pederasty or paederasty (US:  or UK: ) is a (usually erotic) homosexual relationship between an adult male and a pubescent or adolescent male. The word pederasty derives from Greek παιδεραστία (paiderastia) "love of boys", a compound derived from παῖς (pais) "child, boy" and ἐραστής (erastēs) "lover". In French, however, pédérastie has been used as a synonym for homosexuality between adult males (see Histoire du mot pédérastie). [linebreak]  [linebreak] Historically, pederasty has existed as a variety of customs and practices within different cultures.

em55fpn	It's never a surprise people who post these kinds of "fuck everybody, I'm going to go eat fried worms" posts have a miserable time on Reddit.  Reddit definitely has a toxic shithole element, but that's not why these folks are having a bad time. Frequently, these posters seem incapable of reading the room. They know they're one of the *good* ones, and assume their wonderful thoughts will be lots of karma and internet praise. If they're downvoted or receive critical responses, they never ask themselves if they're being weirdly hostile, or if they're actually contributing the conversation. It's always Reddit's fault, not their own.	Neutral

em7os7r	This is like a specific, new deflection, where they infantilise themselves, the honk honk thing feels similar.	Neutral
em7rufy	Funny thing is the r.4chan post only has a single reply, so it's probably just something the OP themselves made and took a screenshot of just to make that post. It was probably pushed down in a few minutes by threads of the usual stuff. Also, that variant of pepe in is nearly always used to make jokes about autism and the mentally challenged, so it's not as innocuous as they'd like to think (though they've already ruined the pepe image in general).	Neutral

emmy6tp	Yo.  I never thought about the whole "don't feed the trolls" thing that way.  And maybe that's not how it started out but you are 100% right that that is the exact thinking they took advantage of.  Really good observation there	Neutral
emmywg4	I don't really give a shit about the Marvel movies, but Avatar blew me away when I saw it in the theatre 10 years ago. I really want to relive that experience. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Speaking of which, are 3D TVs still a thing, or were they just a short lived gimmick? Can you get a TV that does both 4k and 3D?	Neutral
emn49sg	3D TV is pretty much dead. As far as I know, there is no one out there currently making 4K TVs that also do 3D. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There was a bit of overlap between the start of the mass-market push for 4K TV and the end of the 3D TV gimmick, so 4K 3D TVs did exist. If you're really that into the idea you might be able to track one down. I don't know if it would be worth it for you though, because I'm not sure if anyone produced 4K 3D content. What I remember is a lot of multi-disc sets that would include one 4K Blu-ray and a separate 3D Blu-ray.	Neutral
emn73mr	I can definitely see why 3D TVs died out. It's a bit of a shame that it's no longer an option, but it's really not surprising. It would be nice to have so that I could relive watching Avatar in a similar way to how it was originally intended.	Neutral

empb8b8	Who is pewdiepie and more importantly why is pewdiepie?	Neutral
empgj9g	Eh, I think there's a slightly different factor to this case. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As has been pointed out many times over the past few years - it's pretty strange that 'the highest grossing film of all time by far' is a one-off oddity from 2009 whose story and characters had almost no cultural impact. People struggle to remember the names of almost any character in the film, there are no memorable quotes from it in the pop cultural lexicon, no scenes or plot concepts getting referenced or homaged, nobody walking around in Avatar t-shirts, etc. Compare it to Star Wars, Lord Of The Rings, Harry Potter, Marvel, E.T., Jaws, Titanic, Batman, Frozen, or any other cultural and financial *phenomenon*, and its content is a total obscurity. Even Shrek and Pirates Of The Carribean had a way bigger pop culture impact, for their first couple films anyway. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Point being, it's rubbed a lot of people the wrong way that the highest grossing movie in the entire 100-year history of the medium has, for a decade now, been one that's significant almost entirely for a camera gimmick. Even other films like The Wizard Of Oz, Star Wars and Jurassic Park which are similarly famous for their gamechanging technological breakthroughs *also* had iconic stories, characters and dialogue which have long outlasted the novelty of their SFX. [linebreak]  [linebreak] An Avengers film *finally* topping Avatar at the box office feels more like a victory for common sense than brand loyalty, because the *content* of the Marvelverse has had all the ubiquitous cultural impact that Avatar lacked, and it's nice to know that more human beings have connected with something like that, than just been roped into going to the theater for some 3D hype alone.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] A world where Avengers, not Avatar, is society's highest grossing movie of all time is a world that makes a little more sense to everybody, in a time in desperate need of that.	Neutral
emph9ws	superhero movies is such a broad and populous genre at this point as to make statements like that meaningless.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Ghost Rider 2, Black Panther, Mystery Men, Logan, Into The Spider-Verse, V For Vendetta, Fant4stic, The Dark Knight, Suicide Squad and Shazam are all 'superhero movies' despite most of them being more disparate from a story and filmmaking perspective than any number of Westerns or Elizabethean Dramas or Noirs. Making any statement about the *entire genre*  of 'superhero movies' is senseless, yet I see it all the time. I doubt the next generation will lump them all together so cynically.	Neutral

emryf70	There were plenty of 3D movies before Avatar.	Neutral
ems716b	Ugh I know. It gets too much credit/hype for even that. Its 3D was definitely the deepest I'd seen when it came out, but it certainly wasn't worth the insane industry-changing hype, nor am I convinced its what made 3D a mandatory thing for all blockbusters. Again, more reason its all-time record status is annoying and not as well-deserved as stuff like Titanic and Avengers.	Neutral
emsawq0	The reason I loved the movie so much was because it was "sci-fi FernGully" which I give as my favorite movie ever. I actually found the 3D part to be kind of bad, but I guess it's cool that people liked that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For what it's worth, I did use the phrase "I see you" for a while after.	Neutral

emtfees	The main reason why Avatar got so popular in the first place was that is was one of the first movies available in 3D. Whilst it is a good movie I don't think it deserves to be above Star Wars or Titanic. So I think it's understandable that people want that to be replaced by a movie that people were psyched about because of the story and the hype. Plus, I doubt anyone went to see Endgame with the idea of helping it beat Avatar.	Neutral

emxrwrq	It isnt and I see activists and academic decry bad interpretations of leftist history and theory from "woke" but still uneducated tumblr and twitter accounts all the time.	Neutral
emxs5rc	Yeah, I hate when people make that argument about condoms; making them free was a reaction to the HIV/AIDs crisis. Saying it's patriarchal that condoms are free does a disservice to all the LGBT activists who had to watch their loved ones die from an epidemic the White House could've cared less about at the time.	Neutral
emxtgr1	There's still tons of awful shit on Tumblr, but its structure makes it so much easier to avoid	Neutral
emxupfk	Exactly. They're not free to help men have sex, they're free to encourage people to use something they otherwise might not, which benefits society as a whole, including women in many ways, and especially vulnerable populations. Tampons shouldn't be taxed as a luxury good, and just like, say, soap, should be a basic human right, but it's apples and oranges to compare them to condoms.	Neutral

emy88p8	Just here to say that the only reason why I have a Reddit account is that a 15-year-old me essentially felt ''betrayed'' by ''the left'' (liberals) once I started getting replies for talking about my sexuality and gender on Tumblr.

[linebreak]      [linebreak] I could go all day. HSBC bank laundery mula for the cartels, etc. Law enforcement is just to keep the jails full and keep the people oppressed, but they aren't going to arrest some douche sack for flying his 10 lb's of personal cocaine to his condo overseas on his private jet - well he might get a slap on the wrist, but you or I would be looking at life. The top banks and businesses are all above the law, to think otherwise is hilarious. Maybe some shit hole country would try to enforce their law on someone to get publicity to their shithole country but it would be shortlived, and would just be more publicity for said rich person that they could write a book about and make millions more. [linebreak]      [linebreak] I have nothing against rich people. I'm from an upper middle class family and I've lived poor on my own for a long time and it sucks. People want to blame capitalism or socialism or whatever, but it all boils down to people.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Examples of these include big tech with software patents, big farms with seed patents, and big ISP's with local laws that prevent competition by requiring that any new competitor provides internet service to every single citizen in the city (which makes it impossible for a new startup to compete in only one neighborhood even if the demand is there).

emznfjx	I'd say I lean libertarian, but this argument has a little more nuance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In the classic case of baking a cake, I support the private company's right to refuse, seeing as doing so doesn't violate anybody's individual rights. [linebreak]  [linebreak] However, censoring viewpoints is restricting the freedom of speech. It wouldn't be fair for a bakery to say you can't have a conversation about a political ideology in their shop.

ent0in2	Eh I am okay with this my family were die hard loyalists and got exiled to Canada after the American Revolution. Though I find this a humorous take because the American founders were way more liberal than the very conservative British state. I mean this person forgets that the House Of Lords in the UK has representatives from the Church of England.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Being a loyalist usually meant your were more conservative most of the Founding Fathers were deists, had very radical beliefs on Christianity or weren't religious all. This person is just assuming because Europe today is more liberal than the US that was the case back then when it was the inverse.

eof0vjp	TW: Spoilers for Get Out [linebreak]  [linebreak] I saw the movie, but it really wasn't as innovative or interesting as people think it is. It's a solid movie and a good directorial debut, and rather fun as a popcorn flick, but to imply that it's some great work of cinema because it starred black people is jumping the gun a little. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It also kind of annoyed me how when the protagonist is invited to a predominantly white gathering, he is immediately apprehensive, and that racist bias is confirmed due to the plot. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  The ending was also trite and uninteresting: the protagonist just...hits people and leaves. There's nothing new or novel and anything interesting the movie had to offer was over 10 minutes ago when the family's true intentions were revealed.	Neutral
eof1ohh	Peele is pretty good. Get Out was a good movie but *WAY* overhyped. Us was suspenseful, but the plot made no sense and the twist was obvious. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, fun fact, the skill of a writer or director has nothing to do with race. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also also, how does "look at the 'great' American authors," prove that white people make formulaic shit? There are more white people in the world than the ones in America and not all Americans are white. So that's comparing two different groups. Not to mention many American authors are/were great authors and the implication that they weren't is bullshit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also also also, white people don't make formulaic crap, corporations do. Look at Black Panther, for example. That's a generic royal family story where an evil relative challenges the honorable rightful heir to the throne *and* a generic superhero origin that ends with the protagonist fighting an evil version of himself.

He was clearly upset by it and I was worried that I'd been harsh, but I felt better about my decision after a few weeks. I know that's only one side of the situation, and I don't have his to give, so maybe I'm still the asshole, but if someone else told me the story as it happened to me, I would have a tough time finding them the asshole.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sometimes we're conditioned to be overly polite to people to our own detriment, and it's helpful to have someone tell us that we aren't assholes for taking care of ourselves.

eofh544	They rebooted it? I never knew that...	Neutral
eofi14x	I liked Us but let's not pretend it wasn't a basic three act horror film. Also ever since his racist comment I have to have that shit hanging over my head whenever I want to see something of his.	Neutral
eofic5o	Sadly. [linebreak]  [linebreak] At leat it took them 11 eposodes before they attacked Trump,	Neutral
eofivx9	I thought Get Out was decent but US I thought was total crap after the halfway point or so. My main issue with both of those movies is they just aren't scary. Jordan Peele seems to excel at writing A. Very likable characters and B. comedy. The first one helps him in horror movies the second completely undercuts the horror.  So why I'm not going to say he isn't good, obviously his movies hit a chord with many people, but in terms of horror movies I'd argue say he's mediocre when compared to something like Hereditary. Of course I also understand why his movies gain wider appeal, hereditary is in no way fun.	Neutral
eofniga	The example you give is exactly the kind of thing that plenty of folks in AITA would insist that "yes, you are the asshole, he was just being friendly/is a touchy person/whatever excuse."

eofs66q	Haven't seen his latest film but 'Get Out'  played out like a dark fairy tale people of color tell their children... which would have been awesome if that was the actual storyline but it wasn't.	Neutral
eofs7fg	Mmmmm, I don't think stories of employees getting fucked over by big corporations only to get a little power back and kids doing adorable things in literal senses really is the same thing here. For reference that's gotta be 90% of the content on malicious compliance and I don't think that's problematic.	Neutral
eofsh9d	Exactly. I see myself dishing that out a lot. I don't tend to do it in person, with rare exception. Yeah, I have my limits on things I'll tolerate people saying, in person and online, and I don't overly concern myself with "hurting people's feelings" (I'm going to call you out in you say something fucked up). But, Jesus, the test of intelligence isn't having some biting retort to everything that's said. Or a callous dismissal of everything people talk about. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like, I want to appreciate small things. There aren't a lot of big, good things in my life and the attitude I've been developing online (not just Reddit but across most social media) is one that ignores small things because, well, they aren't sweeping systematic changes. Can I have one day where I just enjoy the breeze, or something? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Apparently my own answer to that is no. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sorry if that's rambly and doesn't make a lot of sense.	Neutral

Not to mention that the protagonists/anyone with redeeming qualities are all black, and all the white people in the movie are racist and/or >!part of a body snatching cult organization thing!<	Neutral
eog9ljc	Mostly agree, but...  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My parents occasionally ask me, the internet expert, where to find things. "Have you googled it yet?" Is a question that frequently prompts them to go solve their own problem. Frequently better then I would have because I don't know exactly why they need it.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] They just lived too long in the pre-internet era to reflexively think of google as the oracle of all knowledge and products. To them, knowledge lives in humans or books.	Neutral
eogajy0	Eh. I hear where you are coming from, but it depends on the context. Some things are so blazingly obvious that the fact that you havent bothered to do even cursory research says a lot about your character and lack of interest in solving a problem. I run into this all the time at work: if you waste my time with a question you wouldnt be asking if you took two seconds to try and find the answer yourself, I'm not going to be very receptive to helping you. It's about showing basic respect to the people whose time you're asking for. [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Sometimes it's a cop-out though.	Neutral

eogdubc	I once got into an internet argument (before I knew better) and off-handedly told them to google something.

eogmug3	>how does "look at the 'great' American authors," prove that white people make formulaic shit? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Only someone who is wholly ignorant of American literature can make statements like this. There is more nuance, depth, philosophy and breadth of human experience in the pages of Moby Dick than there are in most books in world history. The same can be said of the works of various other American authors. That doesn't even get into the fact that the groundwork for modern film/television was invented in America. [linebreak]  [linebreak] And of course none of that gets into how America-centric this person is for forgetting that most white people aren't from America and that some of them, like perhaps Shakespeare, are literary legends. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is the kind of person that can't appreciate classical literature because they aren't enough explosions in it and then uses this to justify their racism.	Neutral

eoinuhc	I do think it is a parody and satire as you say but it's not subtle in anyway shape or form.  Usually the best horror stories tend to be a little more subtle with their themes and really most stories in general. Get out to me seemed like it wanted to be a dark comedy not a horror movie but was forced through marketing and Peele to be a horror movie. Neither Get Out or US were particularly scary as well. None of the horror of either stuck with me after the movie. Movies like the Exorcist, Hereditary, the Shinning, Evil Dead all stuck with me long after the movie was over. With Get Out I was like ok that was fun and forgot about it until US was announced. I feel Peele if he wanted to stay away from full comedy would be able to write a really good episode of Dark Mirror or movie along those lines.	Neutral

eoiwn2g	I feel like any time I ask advice for something I have to preface it with "I already Googled every possible combination of search terms related to this, looked at all the results, and still found nothing that helped".	Neutral
eoj82nl	Get Out was great, Us had some nice ideas and interesting visuals but was not much more than a decent horror movie, to compare a guy with two movies to a legendary director is a bit premature. I'm sure Jordan Peele wouldn't want that comparison either so I doubt he'd appreciate posts like the one the OP submitted either. I heard Peele is going to be writing a directing a new version of The Twilight Zone. I liked his comedy and his other movie about the kitten, Keanu, was good too in parts, but in terms of black writer/directors I think Ryan Coogler and Steve McQueen are more likely to be remembered as great directors based on their output so far compared to Jordan Peele.

When we have access to food, we eat it. When we can relax, we get lazy.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] I think that we're going to have to- through trial and error, regrettably- figure out what's a safe and healthy amount to engage with online content.

Sexist violence inspired by a misogynistic ideology still qualifies as terrorism.

epe0v3l	> Like i can agree that our society values the feelings of women more than of men [linebreak]  [linebreak] Does it? The last few thousand years of history were written by men about the deeds of other men. *Maybe* right now, in 2019, society and culture cares what women think and feel. But it's only been like that for...a few years? If at all? (I mean, it's debatable that society and culture cares more about women than it does men....). For literally thousands of years in the West, women were largely relegated to second-class status while we were told that what men did and thought was very, very important. Men's bodies and feelings were valued a LOT more than women's bodies and feelings. It's only been a very, very short window of time when women were even considered to be *equal* to men....and somehow men are interpreting that to mean that women are valued MORE than men? [linebreak]  [linebreak] I think the issue here is that a lot of men on Reddit have a very peculiar and incomplete view of human history	Neutral

epf9mgv	You absolutely, 100%, hate women on some subconscious level. Literally every does. Maybe I was actually wrong to say people "hate women". Hating women isn't an internal thing or a state of being, it's just that misogyny is a thing you do. And a thing everyone does. It's not an individual issue, it's a societal one. We live in a very misogynistic society, and no one is immune to social conditioning. Same deal with racism, homophobia, etc. That's why internalized misogyny is a thing. Women can't opt out of the patriarchy lol.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] In a way, though, calling out and discussing misogyny when I see it really IS projection on my part. When I catch myself being sexist, I do hate it! I hate that part of me!  I've been calling myself a feminist since seventh grade, and somehow, I am still susceptible to cultural misogyny. If it can happen to me, I know there's tons of people out there who must be even MORE susceptible. That's why it's important to always call out and discuss it. We need to recognize the problem to fix it. I hate misogyny in me, and I also hate misogyny in other people. Again, it is not an individual thing. I don't hate myself for being misogynistic, I hate all of human society for being misogynistic. It just so happens that I am a member of the human race.	Neutral
epfa2fi	>And why do you think that is ? Men don't struggle to express emotions for no reason, its because society punishes men who are expressive about their emotions.

epnb1qo	I agree that single-payer would be terrible.  The thing is that most universal healthcare systems are not single payer  and they aren't free  at the point of service.  I have actually handled marketing for healthcare in three other countries and can say that it can actually work rather well if it is set up prudently.  I will try to dig up the OECD data, but I found that wait times are actually not worse in multiplayer systems than the United States. However, they are considerably worse in single payer systems. More specifically, I used to  handle digital marketing for a major private health insurance company in Australia.  Over there, 50% of people have private health insurance. There are a couple of reasons for this. First of all, the tax system over there actually incentivizes middle-class and rich people to purchase private health insurance. The goal is to make sure that the public system is mostly being used by people that have no other alternative. This reduces the problems  that would lead to rationing  and unsustainable cost increases, as you correctly pointed out.  Plus, people that are willing to pay for a private system are going to get higher quality care, which should absolutely be their right.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Also, the Australian government requires people to pay something like 15% of the bill every time they get a service. This is a necessary element to keep people from going to the hospital every time they have a stomachache. It helps keep costs in check and bottlenecking the system so people have to wait forever.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  Single-payer system would actually be horrible. The only country I'm aware of that has the single-payer system liberals seem to talk about is Canada. They have the worst weight times and one of the worst rated healthcare systems outside the United States.	Neutral

epovbo5	To be fair, hospitals are technically another power player in the medical lobby (along with doctors and drug makers as well).  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Regarding health care reform, one idea I really support is pouring billions and billions (think upwards of $100 to $300 billion) on community health centers. That way, perhaps we could provide a baseline of care, at least the basics like primary care (but maybe also dental, vision, mental health, etc)  to the people? Wouldn't it really help folks who have a hard time paying for their own care but might not be fully 100% covered like your working and lower middle class? Also, it's a compliment for your ERs who can only do so much like stabilizing a patient.

And what about your working class people who live paycheck to paycheck and "choose" to go without care, they're not in the easiest of situations.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]   [linebreak]  [linebreak] That said, as someone with an eye on health care systems around the world, how do you think the US can fix its own system and stop being the mockery or object of derision/concern for the rest of the world who not only seem to "cover" everyone (even if it ain't perfect) but do it in a more affordable manner too? There's the argument that America has the best health care but it's not like our working class are on platinum/gold-plated plans nor our mentally ill and substance addicts given access to long-term luxury rehab with tons of aftercare and post-recovery support (pardon the snarkiness but I do want to hear answers from you though I know I'm not going about it as politely as I ought to be)?

epozu8k	Honestly, there are a lot of things that need to be addressed. It's certainly achievable, but it's not going to be a simple fix by passing a bill that says the government pays for everything. We will need to tackle tort reform, because litigation costs around 4% of all medical expenses. We would also have to address the fact that  medical school is a lot more expensive in the United States, which means doctors have to charge more to their patients to cover their student loans. We also need to be realistic about the fact that we have a much higher obesity rate than other countries, which adds another 2% to 7% of  our total healthcare costs. Pharmaceutical costs are higher here and I think they could be reduced a little with cooective bargaining with a UHC but not down to European levels like sanders suggests.  [linebreak]  [linebreak]  There are a lot of things that need to be addressed. The problem is that none of them are the root cause by themselves, so dealing with them is necessary to get a universal healthcare system.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Anyone old enough to remember when "search engines" weren't a thing that existed? Anyone old enough to remember when there was no such thing as "the world wide web"? 'Member acoustic couplers? I 'member acoustic couplers, and that was the last time the "internet", or indeed computer networking in general, wasn't a complete festering shit-pile. It was merely a growing shit-pile back then. [linebreak]  [linebreak] What can we do about it? We can't do anything about it. We're past the point of making things better. [linebreak]   [linebreak] There are no good platforms. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are no good websites. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are no good users. [linebreak]  [linebreak] No good things come of this... this so-called "technology". Damn Turing. Damn *Jacquard*. Fucking ones and zeroes, the only two numbers you need to spell shit-failure. If there was to be a return to normalcy, a return to *decency* at this point, it would have to begin with the razing of every datacenter, the smashing of every server, and the putting to the torch every last network switch.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I may be slightly biased by my several decades spent in the IT industry, however.	Neutral
eq9ak0t	I've been considering the neoluddite position recently, and I'm not sure I'm convinced. Abandoning technologies because we don't like what they do to us is a principled position, sure, but it's not a winning position. Those who abandon the efficiency monster are subjugated and subsequently die out. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Still, it seems like critique can only take us so far - we can reveal the man behind the curtain - expose the system for what it *really is,* but once we become the architects of a new system, it is subject to the exact same process of critique. This does seem preferable to dying out, but it seems disconcerting to most people - to propose any new system is to presuppose a notion of what is good, but to acknowledge that the system might one day be overturned is to acknowledge that one's conception of the good is ultimately subjective hogwash. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, I've been turning more towards theologians to find an answer to the problem, but your mileage may vary.	Neutral

eq9brus	Man, that's a far more considered and thoughtful response than my barely-coherent madman's rant merited, if you were to ask me. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Strictly speaking, my issue isn't with technology - technology is a dumb object, but humanity is a dumber object and has only managed to hurt itself with the power tools. The shed remains unbuilt. My issue is with civilisation, and largely rests on my belief that civilisation has failed. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's like if you were simulating a financial market, but when you click "run simulation", instead of running the simulation, the machine wipes your entire dataset, hard faults, and power cycles. Human civilisation has completely failed to attain any of the meaningful goals set out for it. It's a large-scale tribalist shitshow led around by marketeers because we, as a species, don't understand how to leave other tribes alone and let them be as they want to be, and we're far too eager to jump onboard anything that lets us feel smug about it. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Note that, while I advocate for the destruction of computers, I say nothing about the machinegun or high explosives.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] My position, as it is, lies somewhere between the most far-right of right-wings (constitutional imperialism when?!) and extremist accelerationism. I want to see all the groups, all the tribes, big and small, arm themselves to the teeth and then go at it hammer and tongs. There are lessons that humanity needs to learn, and they're not going to learn them out of a fucking book. They're also not going to learn them without incurring a few bruises, and the sooner they make peace with that particular fact the better. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The thing that stops us all getting what we want, is our insistence that everyone else get what *we* want as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] More fundamentally: *We cannot, ourselves, create change in others*.	Neutral
eq9c38b	> hateful people abounded even in the 300 baud modem days [linebreak]  [linebreak] Well, yeah. I was there. Pretty sure at some point all my blood was replaced by vinegar, but I've always honestly found it more enjoyable to dislike people than the opposite. I personally would categorise hate as my third favourite feeling (behind "drunk" and "awe", in that order) and will maintain to the end that it's an underappreciated emotion. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Thing is, back then people like me mostly took runs at other assholes who'd gotten too big for their britches, because the only sort of hate worth having online back then was for a man's posts, because you knew little to nothing else about him and people weren't so eagier to egopost about their identity back then. Identity was better back then, actually - it was a handle and what bits you sent. [linebreak]   [linebreak] And people back then could take a bit of the harsh language, even respond in kind. These days, everyone's a bloody pissant, weeping and moaning because someone on some chatroom wasn't *nice* to them. And then they wail and gnash their teeth, complaining that they don't get any respect.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Whatever the fuck happened to *earning respect*?	Neutral
eq9e1q5	I hear ya. Haha. I don't list hate as third highest, but mostly because online haters always get me to laughing too hard at how invested they are in whatever it is they hate that they'll never have an influence on in the real world. It's usually straight from the national political talking points list. And they've never had a respectful conversation with anybody they disagreed with.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Lost another friend to cancer tonight. He was an old radio DJ. Nothing like an old DJ to know how to absolutely slam dunk a call in idiot and they'd thank him for doing so. Couldn't even cuss while doing it. Ha. He will be missed and remembered.

For that matter, any topic that has to do with men mistreating women is probably going to get downvoted.

There were always insignificant cranks who did that but now it is a grievance industry and a rapidly growing global political force sweeping the west.

erveu15	People like this is the reason painfully obvious works of satire use it as a rallying call.	Neutral
ervgd7s	This is one of those reason as to why I am a little dismissive of reading comp. "Yes the author wrote extensively about what he meant in the forward, afterward, various interviews, even came back as a ghost to flip us all off. But what did he really mean?"	Neutral
ervgsfp	I always hated the whole "death of the author" thing people always try to pull. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Fans just need to accept sometimes their interpretation or theories on something is wrong and they totally missed the point.	Neutral
ervqf8k	Death of the Author stems from the fact that meaning is constructed by the reader. That is, meaning does not exist unless someone creates it; words are not words (that is, symbols that carry meaning) unless someone's interpretting them as such. Therefore, the meaning a reader assigns *is* what it means. It might not agree with what the author is saying, but it still exists. Since we're working off a system of shared signs, we'll come up with similar interpretations, but... Really, even an interpretation that perfectly matched the author's intent in every way would be its own separate thing, since it's created in someone else's mind. That means that there can't be any such thing as a "wrong" interpretation. I think of a book as a like a blueprint for creating your own work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I had trouble grasping this when I first learned it in college, but when I put it together with previous experiences and thoughts... I've always gotten deeply invested in shipping, and would take it really hard when my preferred pairings didn't work out (haha, "would," as if I'm any different now). I noticed this divergence, where... It was obvious that the intention going into the work was one thing, but the characters I knew felt differently, and that wasn't something I could change. When I started thinking about where the reality of those characters lay... Well, I mean, it was less thinking than something I just knew: their thoughts and feelings were really my thoughts and feelings. So, even if my versions of characters were inspired by the writers' versions, they were really separate entities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, authors often put implications or contradictions into works that they didn't intend but are nonetheless there. Like... I remember hearing this old Korean folk tale about this girl who has a blind father. Despite his wishes, she goes off on a journey to find medicine to cure him. She almost dies at sea, but is saved miraculously, and ends up marrying a prince. Her father is invited to the wedding, and he's in sad shape because he thinks his beloved daughter is dead. But she's able to cure him of his blindness, and he sees she's still alive, and everyone lives happily ever after. The moral of the story is about filial piety. However... Maybe this is just because I'm American, but I feel like the story practically deconstructs itself. The fact that magic is required for a happy ending implies that that is *not* how it would work in real life. Since we see how devastated the father when he thought he lost his daughter... To me, the story really shows how harmful self-sacrifice can be; sometimes the best thing you can do for others is to take care of yourself. Morality tales and propoganda often call attention to their own flaws like that.	Neutral
ervrcj5	> Fans just need to accept sometimes their interpretation or theories on something is wrong and they totally missed the point. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wrong by what metric?  Ray Bradbury has said very explicitly that the central theme of Fahrenheit 451 is, in his eyes, the dangers of mass media and illiteracy.  Are the people who focus more heavily on the way that the story illustrates the dangers of censorship (i.e. the vast majority of people who read the book) objectively wrong for doing so?	Neutral
ervsx7w	They arent because to an extent the book covers that theme as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But when, like in the linked post, people somehow think Don Quixote is some hero when in reality hes a senile old man with heat stroke randomly beating up people you at some point missed the point of what the author was clearly representing.	Neutral
ervtcic	Well, since you said that, the tl;dr version is: without a reader, words are just something we call "ink" on something we call a "page;" it only means something when the reader interprets it. Therefore, whatever meaning the reader assigns is the meaning the text has, even if it disagrees with what the author is trying to communicate.	Neutral
ervuflr	How is it an interpretation when the literal definition of censorship is the banning of parts or entire swaths of media? That's literally what happens in the story, that's not really up for interpretation.	Neutral

erw0hny	I honestly have nothing to add but a stupid question: Is the "Scott" part of the surname? I thought it was just a boring middle name.	Neutral
erw2jg5	I've seen it hyphenated as if it's one name (Scott-Card), but I never remember if that's correct or if it's a mistake I've seen repeated a bunch. Wikipedia's article seems to imply it's a middle name, though.	Neutral
erw6uev	Learning moment: you wanna know the sexual subtext of Don Quixote? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Aldonza, the peasant girl Don Quixote calls Dulcinea, is described as a mannish, rough-hewn woman (Aldonza was considered a rustic name, like how we in English view names like "Bertha" or "Helga"). The subtext behind Don Quixote's fascination with her is suggestive of how some upper-class types viewed lowborn women as more promiscuous or sexual, because they weren't as delicate or bound by the rules of decorum as upper-class women. [linebreak]  [linebreak] As for other women, Don Quixote always operates on the assumption they're immediately smitten with him, and uses his devotion to chivalry and Dulcinea as an excuse to turn down their advances... despite none of them ever showing signs of interest. There's one chapter where a prostitute enters his room by mistake, he embraces her and tells her this, but it's dark and she doesn't understand his archaic language, so she attacks him in self-defense and a fracas ensues. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I hate when people read sexual subtext into *everything*, but these readings have legs IMO.	Neutral

[linebreak]  [linebreak] tbh I actually think Fahrenheit 451 isn't a good example for this because the fact that books are burned indiscriminately with no regard to their content or ideas kind of hugely misses the actual dangers of censorship - that those in power can suppress ideas which they see as a threat to power and their status quo. That, combined with that one frankly garbage spell-it-out-for-the-reader scene where the main character directly talks about tv making everyone dumb and berates a woman for having C-sections makes the whole thing seem *exactly* like Bradbury's old man rant.

eryvwy7	burning all books to stop people from reading at all is 'clearly and indisputably' not the same thing as specifically censoring certain material.  it even says 'parts' right there in the definition you quoted to help.  the two things are in the same ballpark but not the same at all in intent or result. [linebreak]  [linebreak] bradbury making the story about burning all books was obviously going for something broader than censorship.  and whaddya know this aligns with what he actually said he was trying to talk about.	Neutral
erywjda	No, it's pretty weird. I don't know any people that talk this way.	Neutral
eryypvw	The last time I heard „bro code" used unironically was in 6th grade. I'd assume the commenters are around the same age.	Neutral
eryze5g	Ender's Game, despite being a morality tale, also has a *really* fuck weird (dare I say, fundamentalist Christian) take on morality. The entire book is constructed so that someone is able to undertake the *impossibly unlikely* venture of committing genocide without meaning to. So of course Ender isn't at fault, he never knew he was committing genocide!!! But the entire Point of the book (and its sequels) are Ender's moral crisis over being tricked into doing the worst thing imaginable and is just continually driving in how *it's not his fault* because he *didn't mean to*. And it's just like ". . . obviously?" And there's also weird Jesus-y stuff where Ender founds a religion and is scapegoated for the war etcetc all while *it was never his fault*! [linebreak]  [linebreak] They're ultimately not that deep or useful IMO. Basically any other book that has moral points to make is more worth your time. Unless you really want to read a book where someone uses the most extreme, least likely possible example to attempt to "prove" Kantian ethics.	Neutral
eryzu58	I dunno, i think for a lot of people, it's their first introduction to "thoughtful" sci-fi or "thoughtful" literature. It's a gateway drug to reading something not terrible like Heinlein or Asimov or Watts.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I mean of course his work is YA and very simplistic, but it's not *as* awful as like Harry Potter, any of the 20000 YA dystopia novels, or something, where there's literally no moral or thought beyond "be good people!" or "your friends are important!"	Neutral
erz1mva	I'm not proud of it, but I'm subbed there. Sometimes I read the comments looking for more info on the video, but the best comments are the ones critiquing the way people fight. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm pretty sure only a small fraction of commenters have any actual training. It's amusing.	Neutral
erz205n	People that know how kick the shit out of other people generally are really good at deescalating situations because they don't actually want to fight. It's always a last resort when someone won't let it go. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'm saying this anecdotally.	Neutral

es1px1g	Well, yeah, but that doesn't make it any less true. I'm looking at it from the perspective of finding the locus of meaning, and that, I think, (rather ironically), that is something that has a clear-cut answer. I'd also say that Death of the Author is the very reason we can apply so many schools of criticism to the same works. That is, it's the school that supports the idea that there's no right way to read a text, that we can look at it from all kinds of perspectives. I will say that some post-structuralists take it to an absurd extreme, by saying that authorial intent is irrelevant. Which, writing is all about communication, it's important to try to understand other people's thoughts and perspectives. I mean, if all you care about is your own, you're not learning or growing. That's why I prefer to think of it as "Birth of the Reader." But you know.	Neutral

es3knr2	'Fascism' is a very misused word. Few can define what it really means, since it's supposed to be something really really bad. The genuine basis for fascism is the petty bourgeoisie, wrote Leon Trotsky, suggesting it was the over- and middle-class tactic to 'hijack' the true revolution that has to come. A way for the 'parasites' (bourgeoisie) to hang on there in a changing world. 'Parasites' is a horrible word to use about people, but if one looks at nature at a tree fungus for instance and think coldly like a scientist, it isn't a bad analogue. It contributes nothing to the trees existance, and in the end will lead to the death of its host. [linebreak] I recommend Trotsky's writings on these matters, there is a book or pamphlet written before the second world war called "What is National Socialism" that is still interesting and highly readable.

esf0ieb	Western culture highly values the idea of getting laid, especially when your parents breathe down your neck about having grandchildren and all of your high school friends talk about how much they do it every day. To those people, not having sex is like failing life, so they villify virginity.	Neutral

esgd2bs	>a mere handful of years after the dumb joke peaked in popularity. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I mean, speaking entirely anecdotally the garbled version of the joke is absolutely peaking *now*, at least off-site and in smaller subreddits.

esmsft8	Mordhau caught my eye a little after it came out because it's about combat, has lots of weapons, and a few game modes. It has a medieval theme, and people describe this in numerous ways like "deus vult fantasy" to explain why it attracts so many toxic people. Apparently Chivalry (a similar, older game) had the same issue.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] If you were about accuracy, you would be blasting Disney for how much it deviated from the original story with its 1989 animated release. Lets be honest, this isn't about accuracy, this about you not liking the change in general. You don't get to scream about accuracy when your reference point isn't accurate at all either. You are barking up the wrong tree by dying on a hill for a company(Disney) who have a long history of taking liberties in how they represent old fairy tales to the public. Ariel getting a skin color change is just another in an long line and a relative benign one. It's something called Disneyifcation, google it up.

btmjwb-post	And no one should. I've noticed that comments on inceltears are usually loaded with sympathy and insistence that they're just "lonely, misguided guys". The type of sympathy you never see for misogynists in the middle east or India, that you NEVER, EVER would see for a misandrist or "radical feminist". Many of these men fantasize about violently raping and murdering women, openly. Reddit's response?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] "Let's not be concerned. They wouldn't have the guts to do it in real life." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nevermind the real life attacks driven by incel culture that have already taken place, carried out by men that incels openly admire.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The other day I had a pedophile apologist on there telling me that incels  who idealize underage girls are just opportunistic and not "real pedophiles", because "real pedophiles are afraid to hurt children and live in self-loathing." Huh? If that were even remotely true, child sex trafficking would cease entirely. If it were remotely true, pedophiles would pose no threat to society. People really believe this virtuous pedophile shit. Not saying there are none who are like that and are seeking help, but this idea that MOST of them are just friendly guys who don't have any desire to act on their compulsions?  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Deserves a second post. NO sympathy for self-identified incels. NO sympathy for pedophiles or mysoginists, Western or otherwise. Plenty of people are lonely, plenty of people are shy, plenty of people have social anxiety and are unattractive, yet most are not incels and don't subscribe to incel culture. Why? Because it attracts people who are shitty. The End.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If inceldom were a predominantly non-white movement, most people would acknowledge them as a legitimate terrorist threat and not just harmless losers who don't know any better.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Phew..	AffiliationDirectedAbuse
bxoe2u-post	Anyone old enough to remember Youtube when it was dominated by the likes of *Smosh* and other amateur content creators probably scoffs at how *soft* the internet has become. Before graduating high school, I had spoken with Islamic fundamentalists, spammed the likes of David Duke for fun, had no fewer than four people threaten to injure or kill me (one of those also provided a graphic description of how he would rape and kill my family in front of me), and had my first exposure to what would later be deemed by /pol/ as the *schizoboomer* - the archetypal crazy person who insisted to me that he had 'top government contacts' in the British military who *assured him* that the 2012 Mayan apocalypse was real and not a viral marketing campaign for a lackluster Roland Emmerich movie. Youtube's moderation staff at the time was notoriously slow, and never really kept up with scale. By around the 2010s, it became obvious to anyone paying attention that Youtube had become a sump for some dangerously insane individuals. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It was also obvious that the moderation team could never possibly scale to deal with the completely depersonalized nature of these comment sections - they would have to read the comments to get context on the conversation and *then* ban the offending users, who would have a new account set up in minutes (this was before the move towards 2 factor verification across most services, so it was really, really easy back then, comparable to making a new Reddit account today). [linebreak]  [linebreak] This was a problem that social networks and MMOs would find increasingly difficult to grapple with, especially as more dedicated persons learned methods of subverting filters and behavior guidelines (the emergence of the now-cheapened term 'trolling,' perhaps best exemplified by the [4chan raids on Habbo Hotel](https://i.redd.it/9hw4i24r9t231.jpg)). It was remarkably easy to get away with this sort of thing at the time. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For Youtube, the solution seems to be in a crowd-sourced pseudo-AI analyzing viewing patterns and social networks in order to determine who is likely to constitute an undesirable, and removing them. This, in tandem with surgical bans against particularly egregious focal points of dissidence (e.g. Alex Jones) has been their operating strategy ever since it became clear that they could never *read* nor even *watch* all the content they were hosting. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Reddit has taken another approach. Although it has made use of surgical bannings (notably against /r/FatPeopleHate, /r/MDE, and /r/AltRight), it does not have the resources to make use of the more sophisticated methods used by Google. Instead, it relies upon simple social manipulation. Reddit made two important changes to its platform which all but ensured it was destined to become an echo chamber of its young and left-leaning user base - first, the decision to present upvotes and downvotes *as an aggregate* rather than separately. Whereas it had previously been possible to see the numerical level of support *for* or *against* an idea, now it is only possible to view whether or not an idea has positive or negative karma - i.e. it is only possible to see whether or not the majority agreed or disagreed with the idea. The minority opinion thus becomes merely an unpopular opinion - it becomes impossible for the minority to ascertain whether or not there is a minority who actually *support* their ideas. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Second comes the cool down timer - when users with negative karma in a subreddit try to make a comment, they are often met with the response that "You are doing that too much. Try again in 10 minutes." This was (as far as I understand) originally intended as a hedge against overt trolling and thread derailment, but it has had the effect of creating a series of walled-gardens that no longer really talk to each other outside of dedicated debate subreddits without a clear bias towards one group. Once a group comes to dominate the conversation, they begin to 'settle in' to the subreddit and frequent it more (/r/DebateReligion is an example of what was once a very high quality subreddit with a variety of viewpoints that has recently become dominated by lazily scrawled critiques by 14 year old atheists). It also becomes impossible for unpopular discourse to advance itself, because newer arrivals are downvoted and only have the chance to post six times every hour - this can often lead to situations where multiple people *respond* to an unpopular post, but only one or two get an answer, making it initially appear as though the point has been refuted by virtue of the dissident's silence - it's structurally impossible for them to offer timely replies. [linebreak]  [linebreak] All of this seems to me to be very much intentional - and I don't doubt there will be lots of readers on /r/TheoryOfReddit who will claim that the system is functioning as intended (because to them, these ideas are invalid and thus should not be engaged with anyways, which incidentally is exactly how we've ended up with so many schizoboomers on /pol/ over the years).

A while back I saw another mixed person be told she needs to get over herself and learn social skills when she expressed how frustrated she was over people misidentifying her race.

cewwqs-post	Reddit will defend catgirls and even loli CP to the death, but the second furries are brought up, all but the most left-wing subs turn into [a far-right "murder all sexual degenerates" circlejerk](https://www.reddit.com/r/ShitRedditSays/comments/ccvhzp/effort_post_rfakehistoryporn_users_dehumanize/), to the point where they glorify an actual gas attack: [linebreak]  [linebreak] >[link to article on furry convention gas attack] [linebreak] >>Every generation has its heroes.

Someone will inevitably create a "meme" with some about shooting furries, because of course they will, and every time the circlejerk is reinforced and validated in the post's comments. I can't think of any other time where mods have to remove as many *(highly upvoted!)* comments as they do when furries are mentioned. Reddit loves to hate hate hate, but a lot of of them aren't brave enough to hate on actual minorities. They risk a slight chance of backlash. So instead they choose the next best thing, an easier alternative that won't *(can't)* fight back. All the feelings of superiority of hating gays or brown people, but with none of the guilt or backlash! **Bonus**: most furries are bi and gay, le epic win xD! [linebreak]  [linebreak] "It's all ironic bro! It's just jokes!" Reddit's classic excuse to get away with saying anything. "Edgy jokes" is their only excuse. Yes, the tens of thousands of highly-upvoted comments across reddit calling for shootings, gassings, dehumanization and actual threats? All just a prank bro. Something is going to happen one day (well, happen *again*, remember a gassing already did) when another person is radicalized, probably a shooting, and they're going to deny any responsibility whatsoever. And then reddit will go back to business as usual, repeat ad infinitum.	Neutral

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Not to mention, although I don't believe I ever saw conclusive proof of it actually happening back in 2016, I can't entirely discount the possibility of candidate-affiliated shills - think the allegations thrown around about ShareBlue / Correct the Record, or conversely Revolution Messaging.

That is not a natural male response to loneliness. If it's your natural response, **it is because you are a cunt.** This shite is far more misandrist than anything I tend to hear feminists saying.

When he cautions against "identity politics", he's appealing to whites and men in the Democratic Party or on the left in general who are scared of the mainstream political discussion on the left being centered about women and poc.

eii0ebw	Let me tell you this-- /r/Drama is one of the most malevolent, cruel, coldhearted online communities you'll ever find, and even as a supporter of free speech it appalls me that Reddit would allow such a vile, festering hub of bigotry and sadism to exist. You think [slur]town was bad? That subreddit, if you pick up on the dog-whistles (and many don't even bother with that-- say want you want about Stormfront, at least it bans "n[slur]"), will reveal itself to you as Reddit's number one hub for the web's most hardened Nazis, Klansmen, Fascists, and Gamergaters. You'll notice on the sidebar that it encourages members to be as dramatic as possible. That's intentional. They encourage arguments in the comments section. That's intentional. You know the Three Minute Hate (it's from this underrated book 1985, give it a read, it's scary how much it parallels our society)? It's like that, they want to stoke the flames of reactionary rage so they continue to dogpile every progressive and minority who enters the subreddit, normalizing these evil feelings. They brigade from subreddit to subreddit, having an entire cabal of mods spanning hundreds of communities, gaslighting lived experiences of the oppressed and unashamedly bolstering Reddit's homegrown white supremacy movement. They've kink-shamed hundreds of people too, some even... to death. I fear that /r/drama may be producing an entire army of Dylann Roofs and Elliot Rogers, and I highly suggest that nobody dares visit that horrible subreddit, lest you potentially fall victim to its corruptive aura.

eitusrc	Not true, Crowder is more popular and almost any show on Fox news then if you take radio host into account Ben Shapiro isn't even close to the top. He is well known because he debates dumb leftest college students and puts it on youtube so people know of him from that. Very few actually care what he has to say politically though. He averages like 200,000k viewers on his YouTube channel where he discusses his actual political views. A number of those viewers also clearly l don't like him as often you can see top comments calling him a "zionist shill". Sean Hannity has like a million viewers a night, which is more then most Shapiro Videos will ever get. My local conservative talk radio station averages numbers that are close to Shapiro at peak times ffs. [linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Tucker Carlson is the most popular show in his time slot and averages an ungodly amount of people. The most popular figure in the right is Tucker right now without a doubt, Crowder is pretty close as well as his videos on youtube average almost 1 million plus views.

Coincidentally, vindictive idiots made up an objective, statistically significant majority among people who voted for Trump which is why republicans are attacking educational institutions and the foundations of intellectualism while democrats try to increase education spending and make college free/affordable for everyone. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Turns out it's hard to support republican policies if you have even a community college level of education. That's not my opinion, it's just what the statistics say in no uncertain terms. I'll allow you to try and figure out the significance of outliers.	PersonDirectedAbuse

You're tokenizing her. We aren't calling her a token. [linebreak]  [linebreak] This shit is riddled with progressive fundamentalist dogma. First, 'y'all' hate black people is used as the basis of their argument, it's just obviously true, and that's what makes what they're doing tokenism. It's classic circular reasoning. Because you hate black people, your highlighting of a black woman who agrees with you is tokenism, which proves you hate black people. Attempting to disprove racism just further proves how racist you are. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Once again 'bad faith' is invoked to mean, I don't like your argument so I get to dismiss it as fake entirely on the basis of me not liking it.

emxr3mk	This sounds elitist as hell, but while there are certainly many good things about how social media has somewhat democratized the dissemination of thought, I find it depressing that so much credence now seems to be put into the hot takes and half-baked opinions of yokels, naive people, the overly-sensitive, bigots, etc.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] The worst part is how viral it can be when that portion of the population with poor critical thinking skills/no considered opinion of their own that seemingly needs to be told what to think, or those with a pre-existing agenda, get ahold of it and make it relevant by sharing/repeating it and giving it momentum, and now suddenly it's influencing society to some degree. It happens all over the political spectrum, be it hateful agitation that creates fears or negative sentiments, or someone who decides that something innocuous is offensive if you look at it a certain way and creates outrage where there wasn't any. (Of course, meaningful societal changes sometimes come about in the same way - I refer more to Tumblrific absurdities like saying it's a sign of patriarchal privilege that condoms are often given away for free but not tampons.)

emy2q1r	Are you an npc repeating yourself because you ran into a logic loop? [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, you started the message with "Why was I banned **again**", which means "he straight up banned without any warning at first." is wrong. [linebreak]  [linebreak] You also said "I didn't break any rules", also wrong because you couldn't be arsed to read them, and saying it's not offensive to show OCD suffers something like that is like saying fireworks are okay next to grandpa who suffers ptsd.

emy2w85	My point is... he could have said "ignorance of the law is no excuse" and looked like 90% less of a pretentious ass. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, ignorance of the law - demonstrable ignorance - is a mitigating factor in legal proceedings.  For example, if you make a right turn on red in a state where that is legal, but the town you make the turn in has a law against it (and doesn't post that with signage at intersections), your charge will be dismissed - the first time.  (Really, the cop would likely give you a warning.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, the "I said something in Latin, despite the fact that I've never been in the parking lot of a law school" coupled with a total lack of understanding of the concept in the first place, makes him a raging dick.

Not as serious as execution for a candy theft.  He never said it was.  This subreddit is for pointing out ways that reddit fails, and corrupt mods is one of them.  The permanent punishment didn't fit the harmless crime.  An easy way to censor and remove differing opinions is to find minor mistakes and smear them all over people you want quiet.  If any sub gets dickheads for mods, whether religious or racist or simply egotistical, they will use over the top enforcement like this to silence anyone who irks them slightly.  It doesn't matter how little you care about this, it sets a bad precedent.  This sub is about documentation, the upvotes will choose the important stuff, the rest stays to archive where shit begun and where it led to.  From the precedent of r/offmychest's auto-ban system one could fear that r/ocd might start banning people for commenting in r/mildlyinfuriating and similar anxiety inducing subs, which is going to reduce site traffic, and further kill reddit.  Probably end up banning lots of people looking for help, like r/OffMyChest inevitably does by equating them to the worst of the subs they might view or comment their disagreement in.

Excuse me comrade, for I'm not entitled to free speech on most of these multi billion dollar social media websites where your voice can be heard by more people than ever in the history of human kind. We have to protect the rights of these new tech companies, because obviously private businesses are entitled to censor whatever they want on their platform, even though said platforms are historically significant in a way where your opinion can be heard by more people than ever as I stated previously. That's dangerous, comrade, we need to restrict free speech, not through the gov't, but via proxy through corporations that have more influence than any gov't on its' own people. We must control the news feed, comrade, because we don't want anyone getting any ideas, like to restrict companies from targeting certain groups over others.

A bunch of bankers met on Jekyll island off the Gulf coast and created it with no consent from the public. This is an old problem and we're seeing the height of it right fucking now. It was a bandaid after the great depression that was caused on purpose anyhow - the US got rich off the great depression, as Dr. Milton Friedman has described - if the great depression started outside of the US the US would not be as rich as it is today - the US effectively stole the worlds gold by causing a global economic crisis and then Weimar Germany experienced hyperinflation - leading to the rise of the brown shirts and the appointment of Hitler to chancellor of Germany. Man, you have a lot to learn. Did you know that G.W. Bush's granddad, Prescott Bush was an international investment banker who was directly funding Hitler's rise to power?

env3dj8	>First off, isn't that Judaism? [linebreak]  [linebreak] Yes and no. Christians believe in the Old Testament, they still believe that their god had a favored people.

Why does this group get the privilege of experiencing miracles firsthand, but anyone outside the group who so much as doubts his existence is put to the sword.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And like I said, it's offset by Christian dominionism. Some Christians won't be happy until literally everyone, including uncontacted stone age tribes who will kill *anyone* who tries to set foot on their island (see the North Sentinel Island missionary), has converted. Just because the son of their god, who also claims to be their god, has different views than his father, who is also him, doesn't really change that the god, who is the father of himself, really didn't care that much for non-Israelites.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Oh, and Jesus was actually racist as well. In Matthew 15:21-28, Jesus ignores the suffering of a Canaanite woman and refuses to heal her daughter, comparing her to a dog. At least until she strokes his ego. Yeah, anyone can be one in Christ, but if you're the wrong race, it's going to take a little extra to earn it.	IdentityDirectedAbuse,PersonDirectedAbuse

eop08aj	I agree in some capacity, but I feel like it's not quite so straightforward.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I feel that there can be a pushback towards criticism of phones and the internet that's misguided and as heavy handed as the criticism itself, but I think it's important to examine why that is. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Some of it is probably denial, and an effort to protect one's behavior/lifestyle, but I think a lot of it comes from incredibly misguided and generalizing criticism from older generations. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Boomers and above who do look down on and judge younger generations are rarely making poignant critiques. I get there's a sense of a severe scapegoating for any number of reasons, and the Internet tends to be what's focused on, even if it's not actually where the sense of disagreement stems from. Whether it's generational differences, a sense of alienation, or what have you, it seems like phones are often the decided culprit. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Maybe it'd make sense to challenge the motives of the criticism instead of wholeheartedly defending current tech trends, but it can feel so condescending to be regarded as less than and have that judgement cast allegedly bc we are involved w current tech trends. Disagreeing with and roasting those shallow critiques can feel p vindicating. [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, yes, current technology is addictive. Some of it seems to be how we function around the stimuli, but a lot of it is designed into the product. Which to me seems like something overlooked. A lot of the blame cast seems to be accusing us of addiction, and a lot of the defense against it seems to be denying it. Maybe we could do better by acknowledging that these issues are intentionally curated by people in positions of power. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Wow that's a lot of text.

[linebreak]  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I wonder what kind of torture you had to go through as a child, to develop this kind of mindset.

ep0gx6m	I think you're the minority. Incels without hate has way less subscribers than mainstream incel communities. Stop identifying as an incel and start identifying as YOU. As a woman I can tell you right now, I've been infatuated with some objectively unattractive guys many times. They just weren't interested in me! It may sound like a cliche, and I don't deny that lookism exists, but personality and how you see yourself does matter. Low self confidence and poor self image are very unattractive, some of the hottest guys I've ever seen still had poor self image and it was a huge turn off for me. As a man, you're actually at an advantage outside of dating culture (in things that matter, like career and business) because women are judged on looks alone, not on ability. Be thankful people take other parts of you into consideration by default. Speed dating may suck, but it's in no way something that should handicap you. No one will be attracted to you if you label yourself an incel.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] I won't pretend to relate with being unattractive because I am not. But someone's looks has never been the deciding element of if I find them attractive, and many of my friends are dating or engaged to guys who aren't really the best looking.

ep0m1er	That's a good point, and I'm also sickened by the bullshit incels can sprout that borders on lunacy. However, it's also kind of addicting to just be salty about your life problems. I know my looks aren't the problem, I'm not even ugly, but whatever's keeping me from making contact with women or new people in general won't disappear until a long time of therapy. Keeping that in mind, advice like "Just carry yourself with poise and confidence" isn't really helpful. And I don't want to shit on advice given with good intentions, but after a while, it also gets tiring to constantly hear that. So until I got these problems under control, I vent about these things with fellow sufferers on the internet. I *know* that in the end, I'm the one at fault. But constantly reminding myself of that isn't helping my mental health either, so I'ts refreshing to point the finger at someone else once in a while. And yes, the end result often comes across as mysogynistic, however I never would treat a woman in RL any different than a man. So the statement "You shouldn't feel sorry for incels" is kind of generalizing? It may be misguided to pity *some* incels, but certainly not in general. [linebreak]  [linebreak] >No one will be attracted to you if you label yourself an incel.

ep0nfbf	I have borderline personality disorder which often bars me from participating in dating and even friendships normally until I recover. Am I labeling myself or thinking of myself as handicapped because of this? No. Don't let it infect you. You're YOU. Not an incel. Just one quick scroll through "incels without hate" demonstrated very quickly to me that the title is just that; a title. It's not as intense as the other communities but there's so much self-hatred and posts about "suicide fuel" and complaining about women. It's not conductive to anyone's mental health and is holding you BACK from your goal. These kinds of communities can impede therapy.

ep0qjcd	Idk. I feel no sympathy for pedophiles or incels who think the "solution" to their problems is a government-issue sex slave. Having said that I unsubscribed from r/inceltears because I was sick of the rhetoric along the lines of "nobody owes you sex, so suck it up buttercup." [linebreak]  [linebreak] Nobody owes anyone sex, no. But companionship and affection are actually really important to people. Those things come naturally to some. They come naturally to me. They don't come naturally to others. A lot of the time, you can't really learn how to be personable. Yes, you should have good hygiene. Yes, you should not be creepy. But some people just... are. Not out of malice but out of circumstance. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Personally, my friends, my family, my social support, my partner are all really important to me. I don't know what kind of person I'd become if I were socially isolated and people recoiled at the prospect of giving me a hug. It's entirely possible that I'd become an angry, ugly shut-in. In fact, I think most people would.	CounterSpeech
ep0qysl	I have sympathy for them in the "we're all just people" sense of the word.  Like, I can recognize monsters aren't supernatural. They're the product of some aspect of society gone wrong. Maybe they were abused or maybe they just watched too many sitcoms that define manhood in terms of how many women you bed.  If the multiverse exists, I'm sure there's a bizzarro version of me who got himself red-pill'd after an early broken heart.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] But, ultimately, that sympathy doesn't really mean anything. We don't need to nicer to them when they throw one of their hate-filled tantrums. Sad stories are sad, but they don't excuse monstrous behavior.  Most of the people calling for sympathy for incels are just trying to derail the conversation.	AffiliationDirectedAbuse

It took me until I was 40+ years old to stop being anti-social/a-social due to bullying, rape, being continuously taken advantage of, and then bullying by fellow adults including my parents* until I was ~40 years old [*they apologized once they found out I was autistic].  I could see how a young man growing up in a culture of rape-culture, toxic-masculinity, and precarious masculinity could be that bitter and say the stuff they say on incel forums. However, once they start planning to hurt others and going through with even a small amount of those plans they are criminals and dangerous to everyone around them. I think the [Contrapoints video on incels](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fD2briZ6fB0) explains my attitude towards them.	AffiliationDirectedAbuse
ep1oulu	Well for an overwhelmingly large number of people, it makes more sense to just say the thing that's bothering you instead of trying to reclaim a term overwhelmingly associated with bigoted asswipes.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Plenty of people have been frustrated virgins, dealt with bullshit societal problems about sex, relationships, and affection, and that's not something that requires the term "incel" to convey. If you want to  not be associated with that group, then form another term, use the several terms that already existed and predate incels, and so on. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The term "Mary Sue" is a nuanced concept that was used in a very specific context in fanfiction circles and was conceived with that in mind. It was then expanded and used online in informal ways and is a borderline pejorative toward any kind of woman that does anything vaguely interesting on screen. It's use in that context is reductive despite the nuanced background the term's intended and original use had and it'd be more effective to just verbalize what you're actually experiencing instead of using the lazy intellectual shortcut. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Incel if you're serious about not being associated with bigots is what Mary Sue is. Nobody would have a problem with inceldom if there wasn't a large undercurrent of casual misogyny and racism that permeates so much of the communities. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Just looking at circles like incels, foreveralone, braincels, etc it's easy to find a thread of someone saying something to the effect of "I wish I had it easy like women" as if women don't have trouble finding love, relationships, and sex too.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you're honest about this, get out those groups and find better people. Incels are fundamentally not the same as frustrated virgins and the distinction comes down to the casual misogyny and racism that infests the communities. We don't need to get to the extreme of rapists or people who shoot places up to talk about the bigoted aspects of these groups. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you're genuine in that you don't subscribe to that bigoted side of it, get out and get with better people who won't act as a petri-dish for garbage.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Incels are absolutely shitty people, but I think the bigger picture here is that there exists massive online reactionary ecosystems that thrives on radicalizing young lonely men.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] People being insecure about their looks and having an unsuccessful dating life is, like, a really common thing that has been happening since forever. The difference now is that the likes of youtube and reddit are giving massive influence platforms to MRAs, PUAs, red-pillers and incels, and they're using these platforms to recruit more misogynists and further radicalizing them. Instead of lonely guys growing out of their teenage insecurities, misogyny and dating issues, they're now finding an ideology that convinces them that they'll die alone and unloved because women are inherently evil creatures.

ep1qnfr	> I don't really care about being labelled though.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] You don't care about being labeled, and yet you choose on giving yourself a label that doesn't even supposedly fully match you if you have to distance yourself from that degree. Even if we are using them, labels aren't inherently bad. They help give a clear idea of a concept to help identify with others.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] People on the internet are people in the real world too. While there's a cover of anonymity, that really only is a freeing spot for people who stay quiet about their shitty views "in real life," not toward people who find fault with a group that acts as a gateway and enabler to way too many hate groups.

ep3dboa	Exactly, subscribing to an incel ideology is not an acceptable response to being lonely/forever alone - and a fair amount of those alone people are women so good luck getting many of them to subscribe to incel culture. It's fine to feel sympathy for people who are lonely, but that should not make it somehow understandable that they turn to an ideology of such bitter hatred towards women. And not just hatred in the abstract but sometimes with calls to violence towards women, a lamenting of rights granted to women and theorising about systems which would rob women of their sexual autonomy - if not more. [linebreak]  [linebreak] The sympathetic portrayal of the movement by some and, indeed, the movement itself is part of a wider spread of white cishet male identity politics. It is quite obvious that there is a large segment of the internet that revels in misfortune happening to people who aren't in the in-group (white cishet men). This group is a spectrum of people from those who think feminists are crazy all the way to people so radical that they will commit real-world acts of violence. The more general groups (which you can see on subreddits like JusticeServed and the now-defunct Cringe Anarchy) react with sympathy towards people within the in-group and the opposite to "the other". And this movement is also a spectrum in what they focus on - some focus on the racial aspect, some focus on that of gender and some focus on sexuality - though they often share the views of the other groups and the overall theme is being reactionary towards threats to the privilege of white cishet men. [linebreak]  [linebreak] In my view, incel-ism is a facet of this aspect of internet culture, with men becoming the focused in-group and women becoming the other. And, because of this, the more moderate section of this trend of identity politics will feel sympathy to them because of what they perceive as slights by society against men as a whole and they don't want to sound like a "crazy feminist". Though, by this point, incel ideology has become so famously toxic that much of the "centrist" h3h3/Rogan crowd will - rightly -  throw them under the bus. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So, I do feel sympathy for the lonely part of their existence and it is sad that they can so easily become caught up in such a toxic ideology and it is devious how overall internet culture has a movement that pushes people towards this and rationalises it. However, that sympathy is completely outweighed by the fact that the incel ideology is abhorrent. And, most importantly, being lonely/forever alone does not make adopting incel-ism rational. Incel culture needs to be countered, not justified. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I, personally, have my own problems with incelTears. I think they sometimes engage in virgin shaming, which shouldn't be the point in what is wrong with incel ideology. And, too often, I think some also engage in a problematic "Just World" rhetoric, where the only reason that all incels lack success with women is their misogynist ideology (not to say that that isn't the main factor with incels once they become incels) - which seems to imply that most people who lack romantic or sexual success lack it due to a moral failing. As a romantically and sexually unsuccessful virgin, that doesn't exactly make me feel wonderful.

ep7fp8a	Meh, "getting laid is easy" is probably one of the dumbest angles possible on incels, that has nothing to do with what truly make incels bad and put too much weight on them having sex to stop being incels instead of just dropping the ideology.

You act....exactly like you describe black people acting".  [linebreak]  [linebreak] And no, it's not okay to use the n-word as an insult just because you're talking to racists. That 'context' doesn't make this okay. He wasn't talking to them on 'their level.' He was being a racist.

He repeatedly resorted to calling Catlin the n-word for not being able to have a civilised conversation." [linebreak]  [linebreak] > ""Why would you begin our conversation like that?" Benjamin said, pausing the video. "It kind of makes me think you want the internet to open up with a big bunch of memes on your ass calling you a n*gger. It's not personal — no one really thinks you're a n*gger."" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ###Paedophilia [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "In 2017, Benjamin interviewed a Singaporean blogger called Amos Yee for his podcast, The Thinkery Podcast, where the two discussed scrapping the age of consent for sex. During the interview, Yee argued it "should be fine" and "completely reasonable" for adults to have sex with 13- or 14-year-olds. [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "It's controversial because people have a kind of mental block in their minds when they talk about this," Benjamin said. "Because in, I think probably this country, we're in America at the moment and in Britain the age of consent is 16. If you were to say something like, 'Well, I think it should be reduced to 14,' that sounds like a hugely controversial opinion, that sounds like you want adults to prey on children." [linebreak]  [linebreak] > "It's actually not as controversial as you think," Benjamin said. "For example, I think in the Netherlands the age of consent is something like 12 or 14. It's actually surprisingly young to Western, you know, English-speaking sensibilities. But across the European continent its a lot lower than you would think."

And then goes onto talk about "Eddie", the guy he was "dating" at the time. I'm not even going to go into where it goes from there as Sargon laughs hysterically and joins in, because frankly I don't want to type out explicit descriptions of adults having sex with 10-year-olds."[Source](https://youtu.be/MkpYHrC2kCI?t=1630) [linebreak]  [linebreak] "I can be quoted as saying you can **** young boys.

eqsx9fn	No, not until you learn some manners.  Offence is not given it is taken, and your refusal to take responsibility for understanding the effect of your words on your victims, or that your victims *are* victims, is part of the problem.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] The hyperpolarisation the US is leading the world into has turned white and male fragilities into weapons, to be polished and oiled and caressed lovingly.   There is an ecosystem of businesses built on exploiting white and male fragilities, pandering and nourishing them.   There is huge grassroots support, countless volunteers doing the thankless work of rage-reading liberal sites and responding.   [linebreak] *Somebody* has to not-buy all those Gillette razor blades, and these are the people who do it.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] It is going to get a lot worse IMO.  Can Israel vs Palestine be implemented inside the US?  Why not?   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Liberals' smug myopia is one of the reasons Trumpism has arisen and continues to conquer the US, sweeping all before it.   I'm picking a second term of Trump, with a handover to Pence so he can abuse the presidential pardon to get / keep the crew out of jail.   [linebreak] But pardoning requires charging, and I think Trump knows where to find Dems dumb enough to do a feel-good impeachment or charges at a time when Trump is in a position to rescue himself with pardons or even self-pardons to hang on until the handover to Pence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   [linebreak] You know that SJW cartoon of "I'm not racist but ..." where the friend covers their mouth with a mittened hand, and says "shush, nothing good ever comes after that"?    [linebreak] Whenever you catch yourself wanting to write "white people" or "white males", just shush yourself.  Never mind your theories about what you think you are trying to say.  Your assumptions about the existence of patriarchy and racial oppression in the US are both laughable and offensive to a lot of people whose vote is worth just as much as yours.

eqtyiqv	Trump works on the level of emotional truths not external facts.  Emotions like anxiety, fear, xenophobia, anger are very primitive, they go back to long before we were even human.  Mostly before we were primates, I'd guess.   [linebreak] The "logic" used by emotions is largely association, and Trump is very skilled at that type of logic.

equrcol	The SJW principle that tone policing is not allowable is rubbish.  Tone policing is the rule in the real world and SJW's pious failure to use it internally just incubates a bunch of counterproductive messages and bad tactics, with bad results far wider than the concerns of the particular minority.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] A spectacular example is promotion of Black Lives Matter and trans issues.  Bathroom bills etc.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] The Russian troll factory fought both sides on trans issues, BLM and other divisive issues before the 2016 election, correctly judging they would work splendidly as wedge issues.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Trumpists agreed and pushed them hard.    They became incorporated into the very souls of a generation of youngsters.  Kids too young to have much clue about gender build their growing  identity out of ideas like "There Are Only Two Genders".   [linebreak] Those operations wedged a bunch of otherwise left-leaning people over to Trumpism.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I don't know the story of BLM but I'm sure indiscipline and naivety by both BLM and perhaps more importantly its white supporters, handed Trumpists the kind of juicy source material that money can't buy.   I'm not saying BLM was not a good movement, just that they got played more than was necessary because of SJW degeneracy and incompetence.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] For trans people SJWs' self-indulgent competitive wokeness has been a huge factory of material that Trumpists used simply by quoting it accurately with no comment.  The photos and memes write themselves.   How well did that all work out for trans people?	AffiliationDirectedAbuse
eqvfgwu	See this sounds like a good take initially. You have a logical lead up to your conclusion and even arguments. That's more than most "anti sjws" have. [linebreak]  [linebreak] History reveals your words as bollocks, however. Every conquest, minor or major, ever made by a marginalized group was achieved not by being polite and appeasing the dominant groups, but by fighting and screaming and destroying. Civil rights, stonewall, worker's rights, you name it. If anything the minorities of today aren't doing _enough_. Violence _works_. History has proven time and again that violent riots bring progress, being complacent creates stagnation.	PersonDirectedAbuse

eqvt0hi	Everyone can be as uppity as they like but there are times when that can be counterproductive for their alleged goals.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd say Antifa are counterproductive every time they appear in public, in the current environment.   They handed Trump the term  "alt-left" on a plate, enabling his "both sides" story.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] An uppity Antifa gives a huge boost to the growing numbers on the right who have lost faith in democratic processes, see civil war as inevitable and need visible examples of what left wing targets would look like in practice.   Their previous visualisations would have been driving around in pickup trucks shooting hipsters and women with blue hair I guess.  Easy but unsatisfactory in various ways, more like pest destruction than the warfare and honest victory they crave.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Antifa gives them strong, violent men dressed in black, with helmets even.  Anonymous uniforms not people.  Weapons can easily be added so it could feel sort of like a fair fight.   Except the collective weapons and fighting experience of right wingers is such that they could melt the left by pissing on them, there would be no possibility of the left putting up a worthwhile fight.

eqylyxs	I agree to all that.  Destroying is not always needed but some kind of pressure must be applied.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] Timing is everything.  The ideal time is when a relatively supportive government is comfortably in power and can afford to burn some good will from its supporters.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] Now is a terrible time to raise minority issues, Trump will effortlessly turn them into fuel for the Trump Train.  He can't be fought on his own ground.  All abusers isolate their victims, and he has done a superb job of isolating his supporters.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] Causing polarisation is easy and very powerful.   The trick is to recognise or create circumstances where polarising a specific set of issues will wedge opposition or swingable voters into your own camp more than it (and disgust at the tactic) pushes your own people away.   [linebreak] If the issues in the set are synergistic you are unstoppable and immune to scandal.  Trump can get away with murder (Khashoggi's murder would not have been feasible under a principled president), because he found and exploited a compatible set of wedge issues.     [linebreak]  [linebreak] TL;DR   Trans people should try to be invisible until this government is gone.  And gays should dress and act like Mormons at Pride parades.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They should take a lesson from the neo-Nazis.  Do you see them dressed in their Nazi uniforms, goose-stepping and Sieg Heiling for the TV cameras, claiming the labels Nazi, neo-Nazi, white supremacist, holocaust denier, alt-right?  Nope. They define themselves out of any of those definitions, and deny that "crypto-Nazi" even means anything.  If you point out any similarities they say "Nazis drink water".   Also:  Nazis haven't existed since WW2.  Neo Nazis don't exist because Nazis were socialist and who wants that?   Nazis are not far-right because socialism, duh.    [linebreak]  [linebreak] They will presumably abandon "identarian" once the public learns what it means, or if they can't defend its nature as a form of the "identity politics" they decry.   [linebreak]  [linebreak] They are far less hidden since Trump came to power but mainly they lay low.   [linebreak] Look at the Reddit rallying point /FrenWorld to see how shy they are.

eqypvgy	White brogressives are the worst with this stuff. They take a few sociology courses and now they think they can tell oppressed people what they're actually experiencing. If you're trying to be an ally, the best thing you can do is support from the sidelines and let the affected groups do the talking. If they're saying something objectively fallacious, that's one thing. But if they're regaling a personal experience about experiencing, or not experiencing, oppression, listen to them, and dont try to correct them. You cant, it's a lived experience. Theres nothing to correct. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I'd also like to point out that even if a person of an oppressed group says something fallacious, it doesnt give you carte blanche to say ignorant or potentially hateful stuff to them either. You also cant tell them what they 'should do', because they dont 'have to do' anything because of their status in society. The best way to approach this, i.e. a black person who doesnt believe in racial profiling by police due to never being profiled, is to just provide data that proves them wrong, and then to tell them that an individual experience doesnt represent a collective phenomenon. Correcting them isnt your place, nor is diminishing what they say. But providing empirical data to broaden perspective is fine.	IdentityDirectedAbuse

ervja6s	Part of the trouble here is that the question posed by the artist-is-dead crowd, of which I am one, is not "What did the author mean," but rather, "What does this work say?" Interpretation of a work of art should be a sound evaluation of the work, not of what the author has said about the work. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Take, for example, Ender's Game, and the rest of Orson Scott Card's Ender series. In Ender's Game, there's a real bent toward multicultural tolerance, anti-xenophobia, support and compassion, all sorts of positive themes, and this is starkly at odds with Scott Card, who is himself a pretty awful bigot. [linebreak]  [linebreak] So the question, then, is not, "Did Scott Card really mean the aliens to be a metaphor for people of other nations?" Because the answer is probably no, Scott Card is an asshole, but it doesn't matter, because textual analysis of the book allows one to read exactly that metaphor out of it and to support that interpretation with textual evidence. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There are no critics taken seriously who derive nonsense from a work of art. Internet message boards may be full of them, but actual art criticism demands that an interpretation be supported by the work itself. [linebreak]  [linebreak] There's a fantastic summary of the point in a piece of set dressing from the film Birdman. On Michael Keaton's dressing room mirror is a small slip of paper which reads, "A thing is a thing, not what is said of it."	PersonDirectedAbuse
ervthpj	> They arent because to an extent the book covers that theme as well. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Are you actually this dense or just trolling?  This is *your* interpretation.  The other has explicitly said that people read too much into the role of censorship in the book, and your interpretation is in direct contradiction with that.  You're doing *exactly* what people who see something admirable in Don Quixote are doing, you just think your interpretation is more valid because it's coming from the great mind of Illier1 instead of one of some lowly literature pleb.

erw9fop	I use the slur because it goes ahead a singles out the people who aren't going to listen to me anyways.

erxxqzb	I feel like bros before hoes is legit when you're talking about making a really impactful decision, like where to vacation or who to emotionally support at a given moment or something along those lines. [linebreak]  [linebreak] If it's something like 'picking friends up but you got a last minute opportunity to get laid' I think that's something that a 'bro' should forgive as long as it wasn't something drastically important, like being a ride to a doctors appointment or job interview.

eryugl7	Also apparently lots of dudes talking about "bros before hoes" who've never even had sex before.	Neutral
eryvkb8	My best guess is that either he has a hard time finding a girlfriend and/or is always single, so hanging out with his friends is like the only socializing he gets. It's understandable, but obviously he should be happy for his friend that he has a girlfriend, not upset at him for supposedly "neglecting" him. That's why "bros before hoes" is such bullshit. I'd never get mad at a female friend for not hanging out with me as much because they're busy having a boyfriend, husband, or family. I'd be happy for them and understand. [linebreak]  [linebreak] For whatever reason it seems like men have a harder time coming to terms with their feelings towards their male friends because "no homo" so they just freak out and lash out at them instead of just like, communicating to them about it calmly.

White people who know no black people personally and only know black culture from rap music and think it sounds tough. This type generally quickly get in fights if/when they encounter actual black people.	Neutral

es3h7mn	I think this will be EXTREMELY valuable in swaying people. As we fit into EVERY one of these to varying degrees. (Some of them 100%) One of the biggest problems it that the average American DOESN'T. KNOW. WHAT. THE. FUCK. FASCISM. IS... And that's a MASSIVE problem. So I'd like to create a very clear, modern collection of examples people can use as a reference. I would really love it, if this lovely community contributed their own thoughts or examples!... (From me, a supposed "Nazi," Which is a term that has no meaning annymore. Lol.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Powerful and Oppressive Tech companies: We have citizens that are blindly allegiant to tech companies that represents ideas that are completely failing thanks to the very ideals they worship. The definition of "safety" has become a dog-whistle of sorts, as well as the definition of "violence," the definition of the phrase "hate crimes," etc. Have all come to mean "things I don't like," and have utterly racist and violent implications today. Google's "Do the right thing" implies that their employees know America is NOT doing the right things right now. But to openly question that would make them feel like a white supremacist/misogynist. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Different Opinions: This is why you can't try to appeal to radical left-wingers' humanity by saying: "But people will suffer if this happens!" They don't care. I have diseases that require me to get medical attention, and it has made me broke my whole adult life. Nobody cares. There are people in CONCENTRATION CAMPS in this country. (How much clearer does it need to be?) There are massive crime rates and other issues that, of no fault of their own, affect so many vulnerable people in our society. And any time a potential solution, or even an empathetic observation is made: The country BLOWS up. THEY DON'T EVEN WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE MEN SUFFER TOO. Even after you tell them it's degrading and offensive to focus on women on issues where men suffer the majority of the time. And it would take them no effort at all to acknowledge those men. They just HATE men. Which is why they want to change the definitions of words like hate speech and racism. In general, they're bullies who only respect science when it's to fallaciously appeal to nature and go on about "spectrums" and how they're essentially science-deniers in so many words. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Identification of Enemies as a Unifying Cause: LGBTQ Republicans, White people, Black Christians, Middle-Easterners, Jewish people, etc. It's the SAME strategy every time: The tech corporations use these people as scapegoats via propaganda and history revisionism, fake data, etc. To convince you that "these degenerates and undesirables" are the reason your life is going to shit. They don't want people realizing they're the reason you're suffering. They also attempt to turn people against the current government, as they offer protections for these people. This helps these tech-corporations begin to replace the government. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] It makes it easier to brutalize and fuck over lower classes and minorities, and even just poor/broke men. Since the 90s massive amounts of university professors and hate groups, all hellbent on dismantling the government, have been forming in financially well-off white areas, like upstate new york, where people have been affected drastically by their jobs being sold overseas. And angry, desperate people with shit education get indoctrinated easily into all of these arbitrary "social justice" or "dismantling" movements. They now all hate right-wing people, Christians, white people, Jews are all white supremacists to them, and they DEFINITELY hate the immigrants that disagree with their politics when not a single one of them even lives in most of their upper class secure neighborhoods... (Lmao.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Supremacy of the Media: Uh, yeah. Lmao. We have the LARGEST, most expensive media in the history of the planet. We spend FAR more than everybody else, even if A TON of that money could be far better used elsewhere. We've been conditioned, steadily more and more since the Nixon-era to believe this is necessary... And after 9/11, the news media realized that this was a perfect opportunity to expand their agenda to make even more money. This is when the country started to become particularly fascist, and the brainwashing really began. They conditioned us to blindly kiss the feet of every journalist, and to approve of every pointless, harmful cause they champion. They say it's "moral" to do that. This is the argument fascists use because they never have logic on their side. They just call you "immoral" and sic the dumb asses on you to harrass you. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] A logical person sees these media for what they are: Stupid, braindead, and they're MASSIVELY contributing to brain washing and widespread suffering across countless lives, including our own children. If you criticize any of this? Well, they wouldn't want a repeat of Gamergate. They started labelling people alt-right who had different opinions banned from social media for having daring to tell journalists to "Learn to Code", for instance. (alt-right is a dog-whistle by the way. You should know that.) And again, ANY time you criticize anything the media is involved in post-Gamergate era, they can pull the: "THIS IS HARRASSMENT! HOW DARE YOU DISRESPECT THEM!" Card. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Rampant Sexism: Yeah. Men are under a ridiculous amount of attack. Men are harassed more than I've ever seen these days. Men in politics or in any position of power are degraded, thrown an insane amount of threats and venom, and they're mistreated. False Rape Accusations are a big joke to people, and not taken seriously. Anita Sarkeesian said "Believe all Women," to men who told her they've been falsely accused. And she started pushing their buttons until she started to cry and yelled: "Help!  Abuse!  Harassment!" when they disagreed.  And this was seen as hilarious to her and her fans. It ended up in: Jezebel articles everywhere. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And Feminists feel so entitled to men's bodies and their lives mean so little that it's both disgusting and terrifying.

es3vn7a	And, of course: Look at the media crucifixions recently... FULL COVERAGE FOR SMILING AT A NATIVE DUDE?! (Smirking is a form of violence, obviously.) AND JUSSIE SMOLETT GETS LET OFF THE HOOK? And the far-left (Fascist. They're fascists. It's a code word so we don't say a word associated with horrible atrocities. George Soros said that himself.) news sources, Jezebel/Young Turks/woke internet culture, CNN "news," and countless Youtube propaganda channels: Are blatantly anti-man. And one thing you might not know: Is that they very well might try to make those hate crime laws FEDERAL to affect all males nationwide. So we need to be ready for that if it comes to that. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Controlled Mass Media: ^ Those sources I just mentioned, say the Soros funded propaganda sources like: BuzzFeed "News", Contrapoints, Young Turks type Youtube Channels & CNN "News," are the biggest "news" sources in the country mostly. I put quotes around "news" because nowadays? There is no line between news and propaganda these days. This is INSANELY fascist, to a terrifying degree. And a "professional news network" like CNN, with the help of Cultural Marxists shifting the culture in a direction where propaganda and blatant lies are accepted as facts, is able to literally spew revised history, fake science, fake studies, cite propagandists, insist that Cultural Marxists's lies aren't lies, knowing damn well they are. (Obviously.) [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With White Supremacy: ALL WHITE PEOPLE ARE RACIST!!! Lol, but seriously... We are terrified beyond rationality, because of the far left propagandists telling you that white people are responsible for all things wrong in the world and throughout history. And people become SO brainwashed that you're fine with them being falsely accused and losing their jobs if it's "going to keep you safe and not hurt any feelings!" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also worth mentioning: They don't care about the stories of thousands of false rape accusations, made up hate crimes that result in innocent people suffering abuse and torture in rooms without cameras, and mass overuse of solitary confinement, which psychologists correctly deemed "torture." and "inhumane." [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] No, they're more concerned with smashing the gender binary: "Gender-Fluid" You know, our correct choice of words that biologists and academics stand behind... But they hate intellectuals, and don't care about what the academic community thinks. (We'll get into that in a bit.) Black males are a perfect example of the rise of fascism in America: Blacks, males especially, commit I think the highest amount of crime in the country. And hmm, I wonder why? Maybe because even when a gay black male wastes police resources on an elaborate hoax... Well... Let's just say it was a very revealing moment in history. [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Religion and Universities Intertwined: The changing of the meaning of words are a thing because "equality." By the way, rocks and pebbles are microaggressions. Oh, you disagree with me? Well "academics" at this super lefty university said they are. Can you prove that academics didn't tell me that? [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] This is how fascists talk. It's all part of a game they play. ALWAYS LOOK OUT FOR THIS TACTIC. Make sure you keep them talking about the facts and data. They never have any. Ever. They only know how to manipulate and play mind games and construct arguments they can't lose. And then, what they try to do is piss you off so you act up and get angry, and then it gives the appearance to dumbasses and progressives that you "lost the argument" or "got banned LOL." Never give them the satisfaction. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Hammer them down on data and facts. Don't let them pivot. Don't let them argue in "moral territory," because that's entirely "subjective." Moral could mean anything, and fascists call anything they don't like "immoral." For instance: "Immigration Policy." the thing that saves tens of billions of dollars a year and helps millions of people, is "immoral." Just keep it in "OBJECTIVE territory." Don't budge. Don't show emotion. Just expose to everybody that they have nothing to back up their arguments but feelings. Prove that all they do is argue from feelings. Not "FACTS" and "LOGIC!" [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] But yeah: "Women are oppressed in America more than other countries," and "It's impossible for black people to be racist," "gender is a spectrum!" etc. You can literally pretend social science is telling you ANYTHING. "Culture Wars" have been the most gruesome in existence. They think "social science" told us that women are oppressed. You say "no, they're not..." Then they say:"Can you prove that?!" And the "social science" card effectively shuts down all rational political discourse. And they could repeat that for an hour, and people in this country won't even think that's irrational and moronic at this point.

es3xijn	-Corporate Power Solidfied: Bans. They don't have to allow any criticisms or differing opinions. Some of the biggest corporations that pull in hundreds of billions are literally controlling what you get to say and do online. And there's no situation where a corporation can be taken down by the law. CEO's for instance, will be caught purposefully suppressing certain points of view, they could ban all Republicans let's say. And not only will they not face consequences because "they're a private company they can do what they want", and "the first amendment doesn't apply to corporations", but that CEO will also be able to keep his job. Those who were banned? If they try to speak out, they'll be sued into poverty and be painted a liar and be under attack on social networking and maybe even in-person, and they'll have had to expose all of that trauma to the entirety of the American public, their family, their friends, etc. All for nothing. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Individual choice Suppressed: What choices do people even have any more? This is a vicious socialist system that doesn't give a fuck about the working class. They don't even want to give us a voice. There's NO wage gap at all. You're treated like you're their bitch. But you're eternally accused of being misogynist or having internalized misogyny so you can't afford to fight back and keep your dignity by challenging them. And what can you do about it? Start a YouTube channel? You'll be banned so quickly for going against the narrative, your head will spin. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Disdain For Intellectuals & STEM: They literally call science "white supremacy." That is TEXTBOOK fascism for fuck's sake... They hate facts, logic, reason, science, etc. Because a society run by those things would mean these demagogues and progressives would lose their power and control, and things would be forced to become more balanced and efficient, which would hurt the trust fund kids starting this fascist movement in the first place... [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] And fascists laugh at anybody who majors in STEM. They hate any new science study that goes against the narrative, and fascists throughout history politicize EVERYTHING, including science. They hate strong female leads in film now, black people or Mexican or gay people writing Young Adult novels or even TOO MANY of them in the cast in general because then it will be "fetishizing". They want it acceptable by their weird-ass standards or it's "white supremacy." Which is very bad when you consider: They think all forms of free expression are political... This implies that they feel they should have power to dictate if a study's political implication fits into their agenda, and if it doesn't, it should not be allowed to be published. (Luckily they're failing miserably at this... For now.) Them shutting down certain types of studies would have drastic consequences. And we need to look out for that. What if biology, chemistry, physics, and neurobiology, for instance would have gotten shut down the way radical left-wingers wanted it to be? Those are very important fields of studythat have done an amazing amount of good for our evolution as a species. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Obsession With Hate Crimes & Abandoning due process: Oh, man... The VICIOUS voyeurism and love of witnessing suffering here is insane. Our media is trying to desensitize us to it, while at the same time make us view it as "honorable," and/or "necessary." To actually encourage us to be entertained by it. They insist that: [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] "It's immoral, and that that person is totally a victim of a system that led them down this horrible life path that resulted in them becoming a criminal.  They're just an oppressed individual who should have no accountability, and had no choice but to break the law. No, I can't prove that the system is oppressive... Or back up any of my other claims... And there are effective ways at reducing crime that don't abandon due process... But NO! I'm a fascist, and I don't believe that there's such thing as innocent until proven guilty! We're all problematic, and stuff! ESPECIALLY WHITE PEOPLE! White males, and Christians, and Jewish babies, and stuff! WHITE PEOPLE ARE ALL RACISTS! *Cultural Marxist chant "We will not be silenced by your violence" over and over again while fantasizing they're overthrowing the government and evil white men* [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] To them, this man is a saint who decided to fake a hate crime because he wanted to start a conversation... He thought that since he couldn't actually be a victim of a hate crime, he'd make one up so he could gain all the sympathy he garnered as if one actually existed. And maybe get an extension on his contract at his lucrative Fox show... But nope. Fascists don't like accountability one bit. Hence why he was allowed to get off scott free... Because abandoning due process = LESS accountability for those on their side.	AffiliationDirectedAbuse,IdentityDirectedAbuse
es3ya0k	-Rampant Cronyism & Corruption: This is another obvious one. It's terrifying to think that it's transparent now... THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TO TRY TO HIDE IT. That is a RED FLAG, you guys... I mean, Google is saying they're going to rig search engine results and YouTube trending charts to avoid another Trump term... And even dishonest reasons sometimes. They don't have to tell the truth, they can do terrible things that screw the working class, they can wage unjust wars, they can take money from shady sources, and what are we going to do? It's like they're taunting us with that: "Yeah, I just screwed you over, and everybody knows it was me. And I already have billions, but I felt like having a little bit more. And everybody knows I have all your information already. And nobody cares. What are you going to do about it?" Kinda like how Google got rid of the euphemisms, and straight up started admitting banning people they don't like: "ALT RIGHT!" Hmm... You know what that sounds like? Jewish people. Only instead of stars of David, they'd better have their Democrat memberships on them, they're going to start banning more and more conservatives now, or they're going to be calls to their employers to fire them from their jobs, and their kids are going to be starving on dirt floors getting assaulted by Cultural Marxists accusing them of misogyny and white supremacy. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, Cultural Marxists is going to be able to shred evidence of their atrocities easier as Google is starting to use their Authoritarian powers to get rid of the people warning us to prevent them from doing this. [linebreak]  [linebreak] ​ [linebreak]  [linebreak] -Fraudulent Elections: This is the iffy one. This is LUCKILY the one that isn't 100% certain. I know that the polls, as Noam Chomsky once said: "Are designed to control the voters." And influence how we vote. I know Google is going influence the next election. And I'm from California, one of the most liberal states in the nation: And THOUSANDS of people who were registered as "Republican," as you had to be to vote for Donald Trump, were changed to either "Liberal," "Libertarian," or "Independent," due to a "glitch in the system." (Hmmmmm.....) But that isn't a regular occurrence so much. I mean, Trump winning against a 20 year-congresswoman and former first lady is astounding. That one is still up for debate.

es7tofs	it's not that they lack empathy so much as it is that they actively reject and suppress it. so much of their ideology revolves around total rejection of the other, and they see people who value empathy and compassion towards people unlike ourselves as weak or stupid.	AffiliationDirectedAbuse
es7ugpr	I can't help but feel like they adapted this "troll" mentality. It's almost funny to them to do the exact opposite of what's right just to get a rise out of folks who have compassion and common sense.

es7v9om	Empathy seems to be going by the wayside, it's a [linebreak] quality we're encouraged not to embrace. And this modern age of ours is not helping things much with on demand everything. Very little room for engagement. I tried to see things their way and gain a different perspective. Went to the churches. Shot the guns. Listened to their pundits. I never felt welcomed or challenged to change my view. I only ever encountered entrenched hostility from these folks. And the sad thing is that a lot of the ideology isn't even what we're up against. For some of the older folks sure, but the younger people seem to have this need for attention and engagement that isn't even political, or for the sake of displaying their platform.  It's not for me.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] Last time I checked, anti-police and anarchist memes were being highly upvoted on furry\_irl and even slightly conservative posts were being downvoted to hell and back.

The entire fandom has given the keys to the fascists with their constant appeasing and dehumanization, regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, these "far left" individuals are doing more to help fascism then literal fascists ever could. There's a reason why there's a well-documented furry->alt-right pipeline and a lot of it has to do with how the fandom glorifies fascist narratives. [linebreak]  [linebreak] I've seen quite a few people fall from "ha ha joking" into outright Nazism because that environment radicalizes.	AffiliationDirectedAbuse
eu6l1dw	>regardless of whether you want to admit it or not, these "far left" individuals are doing more to help fascism then literal fascists ever could.

[linebreak]  [linebreak] kinda vibe from that	CounterSpeech
eu6m6l4	Oh, ok, *now* I see what you're saying. First I thought you were saying being far-left pushes people right. Yeah, the "ironic" self hatred is is a problem. Negative stereotypes can become internalized to people within the group that is being mocked, which leads to things only getting worse. [linebreak]  [linebreak] Also, if there's a furry->alt-right pipeline, I don't think it's "well-documented," because I can't find anything on it at all. Any source?	Neutral

eu90ih1	As a non-furry [linebreak]  [linebreak] I also think it's weird because I feel like... furry stuff is pseudo-mainstream, so I don't really get why Redditors act all scandalized like it's some crazy, outrageous deepweb fetish. Like... "anthropomorphic animals" have been a major part of popular culture for basically the entire history of popular culture, going back to the mass produced childrens books of the 1800s, into cartoons and comics of the 20th century, and now video games. It's not *that* strange that people would develop an affinity (no pun intended) for them when you grow up being bombarded with Cheetara and Lola Bunny your whole childhood. Most furries are like 90% human, 10% other.  [linebreak]  [linebreak] Like yo, Sonic fans aren't into Rouge the Bat for her ears and wings, they're attracted to her "based-on-a-cartoon-human" hourglass body.	Neutral
eua2mzh	The one that gets me is "I don't hate them, I just make fun of otherkin!" And I'm thinking...if the person isn't doing harm to anyone else, why do you think "I'm not really bullying this one person by calling them a degenerate, I'm just making fun of a slightly different group of people" is the gotcha to shut everyone down? [linebreak]  [linebreak] If you think LGBTQ people are closeted a lot, just wait until you see how many LGBTQ furries are closeted, and I'm guessing you got your stats from that same poll that indicates that the rates of being closeted skyrocket even higher if you're both LGBTQ and a furry. [linebreak]  [linebreak] People like Sonic Fox and the like being able to display themselves publicly because they can feel comfortable enough knowing their existence isn't a crime or having fur cons is a big deal because dipshits dumping on furries. [linebreak]  [linebreak] It's one of those things where even if a "furries aren't people" joke doesn't seem like a big deal, if you've interacted with enough people, odds are you've run into a furry sooner or later.
